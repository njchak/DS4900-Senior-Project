One of the deciding factors of where I relocate to is if there is any local music community in the area. I've been to Miami several times but mostly experienced the more touristy aspects of the city. I've been to Wynwood Walls and I figure there must be some sort of artistic collective in the area. 

If anyone can provide me with any info or a better place to post this please let me know.

I can't decide between Komodo and Zuma. This sub seems to love Matsuri, but I'd rather go somewhere with a nicer atmosphere, even if the sushi isn't quite as good. And I know Naoe is another option - I'm not afraid of the cost, but it feels like it would be too stuffy for us (though if somebody wants to convince me otherwise, I'm all ears).

So can anybody contrast these restaurants for me? Like value and uniqueness and atmosphere and deliciousness. Thanks so much!",Komodo or Zuma,1613604722.0

We've had an influx of people deciding to move to Miami and asking repetitive questions. Moving and tourism questions should live in this here.

**BEFORE SUBMITTING A QUESTION HERE, PLEASE READ THE WIKI!**

Mod extraordinaire [/u/iamthemarquees](https://www.reddit.com/u/iamthemarquees/) compiled and built a straight up amazing wiki and it's FULL of good info. [Please look here first.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/wiki/index)

**Moving questions** must include some details, generic ""uh, where should I move?"" questions without budget, lifestyle, rent vs buy, or indications that you've done more than just plopped in here asking us to do your work for you, will be removed.

**Tourism questions** should also *be respectful*, Miami has experienced a large COVID outbreak with over 372k+ cases thus far. Asking questions that are COVID insensitive will lead to you being mocked, your question being removed, and you being banned.

We're planning on travelling next month for 3 days but we don't have a car nor planning on renting one there. So, we ideally need to be in walking distance to visit most places, go to restaurants, or even stay kinda late in bars and not be ''scared'' to walk back to AIRBNB.
Which areas you would recommend the most? ( safety till 9-10pm to walk back f we drink in a bar )
PS : Lastly, we want to try mainly local restaurants and avoid as much as possible tourist restaurants where the food is just overpriced!

I know that a lot of my friend's have had their grandparent's homes broken into, and many times they just make their grandparents live at home with them.  I may be leaving Miami within the year. They're more than welcomed to move in with me, but my elderly parents want to stay in Miami. They also like living at home. The house is small, and is actually okay for two people. 

Unfortunately, their home was probably cased not too long ago.  They have great neighbors, but one of the neighbor's sons just got into college, and his new friends are somewhat questionable. It is possible the home was cased by one of his friends. (Guy looks familiar and car is recognizable from the cameras). The kid was looking around through the front windows at night, and it has startled them, especially my dad. My mom just kind of wrote it off after a day or so.

They have a couple of DIY cameras outside, so luckily, I was able to see what happened, but they probably need some security company, like Honeywell. 

Right now all they have are a couple of cameras, and maybe a bar for the front door. The door is not according to code, and opens from the outside-in. They're heavily armed, but not sure how much that will help them. I told them to try and get a dog and put more cameras and possibly some outdoor lights. I try to opt them out of all those stupid sites that list their names and ages next to the home address.  Just wondering what some of you all have done down here. Thanks and be safe!","Miamians, how do you keep elderly parents'/grandparents' homes safe?",1611114355.0

I lived in NYC before which no doubt has its own flaws. But I never experienced the lack of humanity on such a wide scale as I have in Miami. 
Little things like trying to get food delivered to my apartment is near impossible because places ‚Äúrun out of food‚Äù randomly or stop delivering altogether after 8PM. I thought this was a major city!! You know in New York restaurant workers are actually willing to work a late shift and deliver food after dark right? 
I tried getting a plumber out here after contacting my landlord and they gave excuses and didn‚Äôt come for two weeks. Hired my own guy out of pocket because I couldn‚Äôt wait any longer. 
And Every fucking thing is under construction out here. I understand they‚Äôre trying to improve the city for the future but there‚Äôs no consideration for the people who CURRENTLY LIVE HERE. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the covid shit man.

643,1609544966,"I moved to Miami not too long ago, I live in one of the surrounding cities. I love Miami/Florida, the weather, the things to do, the crystal clear water on the beaches, the diversity of food, the  \*lesser traffic than other big cities, the no state income tax, the proximity to other travel destinations, the architecture.

What I am suffering with is handling the mentality of the people in Miami. I thought it was going to be actually filled with respectable, educated adults.

It's turned out to be filled with a bunch of babies financed up to their nostrils in debt with overweight egos and attitudes to compliment the shady loans and shorted bank balances. Seeing the super cars and artistic houses + furniture in my neighborhood I was under the impression people had done well in their careers with an honest business. Turns out most of them are also debt lovers, all superficial, who love to scam others including their own workers but trying to sell overpriced garbage while paying poor immigrant workers a less than minimum wage. 

**I'm always amazed; how often a handyman, painter, gardner, doordash driver thanks us for being kind and patient (not even tipping more) because the majority of South Floridians treat them like they are inhuman garbage.** 

What irks me most, except for a few stars the majority of these guys are going to drown in debt before Miami ever drowns from global warming. Not like they have any true success to show. 

Again, beautiful city, but not sure if its for us. Is this just what I am feeling or is the sentiment similar to other people about the general attitude of Miami...

Am I just seeing a select group of people or is this really the actual attitude of Miami?

I hadn‚Äôt planned on touching this subject related to [u/Zorrospades](https://www.reddit.com/user/Zorrospades/) post about the shame of being cuban american but he decided to reply to one of my comments on a separate video: 

&gt;‚ÄúJust because im ashamed of what we cubans have become as a society does not mean i get to talk down to new immigrants.Get yo facts straight papo!‚Äù

So Ill make this a post  on the sub because I sense some hypocrisy in all of this so fuck it lets call it out. 

The parts of his post I would like to highlight are these:

&gt;‚ÄúIm embarrassed and ashamed to say that im cuban American now‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWhen i arrived to this country almost 15 years ago, we weren't like this.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúIt's like they brought Cuba with them.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúI don't even say im cuban American anymore because i can literally see the sudden change in people's faces when i do.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúCubans used to be decent, hard working honest people.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúPart of the reason Miami is Miami is because the cubans who arrived here in the 60's built a foundation for the latter. ‚Äú

In this post there is a clear difference the author points out between himself and the new cubans, and I dont think anyone can argue that zorrospades doesnt feels superior to them. His generation is hardworking, educated, and honest. Unlike the generation that got here recently. 

So I dont feel like saying ""you talk down to the newer immigrants"" is incorrect. Not sure which *facts* im ignoring that show the opposite, after seeing you call a whole group of people lazy, uneducated, and dishonest.

And if you want to make this a ‚Äúi dont talk down to new immigrants, i talk down to new *CUBAN* immigrants!‚Äù ok, doesnt really change anything.

[u/Zorrospades](https://www.reddit.com/user/Zorrospades/), you seem to be unaware that the way you look at those new immigrants is the same way you were looked at when you got here. Obviously not by your Tia who was letting you sleep on the couch until you got settled, but the broader body of people was definitely not cheering for you. You were probably too young and or new to this country to understand how the country saw you (this is not saying anything negative about you, we all have to go through the same thing).

I'm not sure of any type of new immigrant group coming to this country, be it from eastern Europe, Asia, Latinamerican, or Africa (especially Africa), where the consensus in the US was ‚Äúman I‚Äôm so glad people from X country are starting to come over in droves, this is only a positive thing since they are all hard working, honest people, and will bring diversity to our communities which we all love!‚Äù 

The cuban generation that came in 2006 was not the exception. Not sure why you think you are special. You really think you were the last ‚Äúgood‚Äù generation. Okay sure. 

And the old cubans from the 60s talked shit about you 2006 cubans as well. And the 80s cubans, and the 90s cubans, and now you do the same. And guess what, the 2020 cubans are gonna talk shit about the 2030s cubans \*guaranteed\*

‚ÄúBeen too long in the island, born under communism, that's all they know, and they are gonna bring it over here. They are used to not working, lazy, freeloaders.‚Äù Definitely a way you were looked at as well by some, even if nobody went up to you and said it to your face when you were 12 and had just gotten here. 

All you have to show for your opinion is some anecdotal evidence. But your uncle agrees with you so it must be true!   
So not really anything reliable. Show me some data that accounts for economic, foreign policy, US law, and other social factors which can point to the growth of new cuban immigrants rate of INVENTO, like you call it, which shows a clear decline in honesty, work ethic, or education which is not directly correlated to the environment they live in. \[If you can find that information and put it together in a coherent way you might as well write a book about it and youll probably be a bestseller. At least with all the older generations of cubans you praise.\]

&gt;‚ÄúI don't even say im cuban American anymore because i can literally see the sudden change in people's faces when i do.‚Äù

You got nobody to thank for that but yourself, you spread this view of cubans which follows  every new generation around. You are not alone tho, I expect some Venezuelans  to do the same, and have already started hearing the same rhetoric from my coworkers. And they been here like 3 years lmfao give me a break. 

I just hope you become a little more aware of your surroundings and get off that chusmerio that has you spreading things as if it were fact. As if you could prove cubans are worse now than before.

We had a table that seemed to be away from the main dining room, if I remember correctly, but the super awesome part was that above the table was a rope netting, and halfway through the meal, we all climbed up into it and the waitstaff continued to serve us drinks by climbing up to deliver them to us.

Sadly, this is almost all I can remember.  I think I remember a lot of reds and blacks in the decor. I think our ""table"" was a round, super cushy booth-like setup, complete with a ton of pillows.

I was young and we were partying, so I got super drunk and unfortunately can't remember much else.  Anyways, I'd love if anyone had any idea what I'm talking about so I can try to find some pictures!

I moved to Miami in August. More specifically I moved to Biscayne Park. My girlfriend and I noticed two things we were hoping residents of Miami could resolve for us. The first is cops are often driving around with their lights on. Not flashing. No siren. But blue and red are lit up, and they're just cruising down the street. This happens so often we suspects it's more than just a mistake (i.e., random cop left her lights on after the last scene she visited). What's the deal? At first it threw us off because we kept thinking we were being pulled over, haha.

Okay, the second issue is often at night cops drive through my neighborhood in Biscayne, with lights on *and flashing*, but no siren. Again, for a while we thought people were getting arrested, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

So what's the deal with Miami cops and their lights?

[Two residential areas in Coral Gables ](https://preview.redd.it/9mi04ukp89261.png?width=1590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5a1309f202c58dc9b92677831e02771b7478ad5)

Intro: I wanted to do a local case study on how property is taxed here in Miami based on land use. Here in Miami land is a premium since the city is limited geographically with to ocean to the east and the everglades to the West and Broward and the keys to our north and south. Therefore the amount of usable land (for housing, commercial, industrial uses) is fixed. This is even more true in highly productive and desirable areas like downtown or the beach. For every plot of usable land the city also has to build and maintain infrastructure (roads, water, sewer, electricity, schools, police, firefighters, telecommunications, public transit) and this is all paid for by local property taxes. But not every plot of land contributes more than it takes. Generally the bigger the plot the more it costs the city to maintain infrastructure (longer roads, longer pipes, longer cables, longer distance for emergency vehicles). But a bigger plot doesn't necessarily mean it pays more, to the contrary many times small plots pay much more than smaller despite being much less taxing on the city's budget. This all come down to land use, if an area is zoned for a more dense land use, it will be more productive for the city tax wise. Below is a random, but very common example.

&amp;#x200B;

For this I picked this area in Coral Gables which has two distinct residential development/zoning areas. The yellow are is known as ""Villa Majorca"", a 6 story, 36 unit apartment building near the ""downtown"" of Coral Gables. The red area directly next to the building is a collection of 18 plots of single family homes and two plots for duplexes. 

The yellow area take sup exactly 38,250 square feet of land and pays $199,953 ($5.22 per sq feet) in property taxes to the city every year. The yellow area  provides 36 units of housing.  

The red area collectively takes up 153,365 square feet of land and collectively pays $195,266 ($0.78 per sq) in property taxes to the city every year. The red area provides 22 units (18 single family + 2 duplex) of housing. 

The yellow area takes up 4 times less space but contributes 6 times more (per sq) in taxes to our city. At the same time the yellow area costs the city less in infrastructure maintenance (less feet of pipes, wire, and road to maintain) when compares to the red area. 

The takeaway is that it is economically smart for city to encourage more dense zoning near existing urban development (not necessarily for 50 story luxury towers, but more laid back medium rise development where the average person can live). The result of this is more housing in places where they are needed (The red area could contain 4 ""Villa Majorcas"" totalling 144 housing units). And also more needed funds to the city since the city receives more net income per sq with these types of developments. Those extra funds could go a long way to making our community a lot better.   


Thank for coming to my Ted Talk, please let me know your thoughts. I plan to do another one of these analysis with retail/commercial space instead.

I've called the FLHSMV (apparently they dont allow you to hold for some reason), i was on hold for 30 minutes with the miami dade tax collector customer service line before my hold was just dropped, I've tried calling a bunch of DMV offices to no avail, i've searched everywhere and have only found info for other counties such as Bay County [https://www.baytaxcollector.com/motor-vehicles/license-plate-surrender](https://www.baytaxcollector.com/motor-vehicles/license-plate-surrender)

I'm only freaking out about this because Florida suspends your license (in this case my new out of state license) if you don't return them. Driving with a suspended license can be a class B misdemeanor here in Utah. I don't want to have a criminal record simply because Florida does a poor job providing adequate customer service regarding punitive measures (suspending licenses) they enforce.

1149,1605334933,"Hey guys, this post is a continuation of a previous post where I asked r/miami whether they would be okay with a gas tax of varying amounts in exchange for expanded transit (metrorail). The result were 132 votes in favor of a gas tax of any amount vs. 55 votes for no taxes (70% vs 30%). 

But after conducting that poll, I wondered if that tax could even raise enough money to fund any substantial expansions to Miami's metrorail. So I tried to do some math to find out. 

There's no real statistics on how many cars are in Miami or how much miami spends on gas per year so I had to estimate all this to get a reasonable and realistic number. So according to a 2019 census, Miami-Dade has 2,716,940 residents. But not all of them are drivers or are even old enough to drive. So instead I'll be conservative with my estimates and use the number of people who registered to vote in Miami-dade for the 2020 elections:1,517,189. All of these should at least be old enough to drive although this excludes teen drivers and drivers who are not citizens. Also out of the 2.7 million residents a good 20% don't own cars, so settling at about half that number with 1.5 million seems conservative enough.

So there 1.5 million residents on the road with the average person driving 13,500 miles per year. The average mile per gallon in these vehicles was 25 mpg. So the average person fills up some 540 gallons every year and each gallon costs them about $2.00. The average amount spent on gas comes out to $1080 per month. So our 1.5 million drivers collectively spend $1,500,000,000 (1.5 billion) every year. 

So if we increase gas prices **by $0.20** via a gas tax:

Average person cost: **$1188** 

Total spent on gas: **$1,782,000,000**

Total Revenue: **$282,000,000**

**By $0.50:**

Average person cost: **$1350**

Total spent on gas: **$2,025,000,000**

Total Revenue: **$525,000,00**

**By $1.00:**

Average person cost: **$1620**

Total spent on gas: **$2,430,000,000**

Total Revenue: **$930,000,000**

**By $2.00:** 

Average person cost: **$2160**

Total spent on gas: **$3,240,000,000**

Total Revenue: **$1,740,000,000**

&amp;#x200B;

So this may or may not surprise you, but it's big money. So what can we even do with that kind of money every year? Well the best statistic we have for how much a metrorail expansion would costs comes from Miami‚Äôs most recent Metrorail expansion which was the 2.4-mile Airportlink. That ended up costing around 200 million per mile (steep). So with a 20 cent gas tax we could fund 1 new mile of metrorail every year. Not great, but it's a lot better than nothing.

But let's assume that the county got a loan for 2.5 billion dollars to be paid over 30 years at 6% interest, the county would only have to pay 14 million every month (while collecting 16 million in taxes). With 2.5 billion, the city could instantly afford a 12.5 mile expansion to the Metrorail. This is only with a modest 20 cent increase in what we pay for gas. 

Thank for coming to my Ted Talk, but seriously if the county seriously considered this proposal and a majority of Miami dade voters consented, we could one day have this imaginary but really awesome metrorail map:

So I‚Äôm a Canadian, I live in Calgary right now and I want to move some place warmer and I love the idea of Miami because I‚Äôm learning Spanish and it seems like a good spot to use that. Anyways, my ideal plan right now would be to go ‚Äúvisit‚Äù for 6 months ish because I‚Äôve heard that‚Äôs the maximum amount a non citizen can stay without a visa. I would be travelling with about $10,000 cad (roughly 7k) and I would also be working as a street musician and performing artist wherever I can find payed gigs. So I need to know where would be a good area (affordable, not sketchy, close to places with high foot traffic) to rent a room, also I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be able to sign a lease on my own so I would have to find someone to room with, so where is a good place to find roommates online or if anyone on here is doing that feel free to reach out to me. Also is there a good online community forum that I can pre build some relationships with trustworthy people so when I get there I‚Äôm not totally new. I‚Äôm willing to put the work in before hand to make it as smooth as possible. Also any other tips or stuff I should know about the area that someone wouldn‚Äôt necessarily know so I don‚Äôt get myself into trouble LOL

Vote tabulation takes time, and [each state has a different rule on when they must certify their votes by](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results_certification_dates,_2020). While this may seem disorganized, this decentralized approach actually helps make sure no one person, entity, or organization can influence a nationwide election. They would need to interfere in every state following different rules simultaneously, an immense undertaking.

In Florida that means that until **November 13th** vote by mail ballots will be received and counted per  ¬ß101.6952(5), F.S.

The state then has until **November 15th** to finish tallying these votes and must certify the results by 9am per  ¬ß102.111, F.S.

Then the State waits a month until **December 14th** to cast and certify their Electoral College votes.

Then finally on **January 6th** the electoral college vote will be tabulated and certified.

So watch whatever you want tonight and celebrate if the estimates seem to favor your candidate. But do not forget that it's just that...an estimate. And it won't be real and final and finished until the first week of January.

My voting pamphlet/card led me to a location I had never gone to before and as I'm approaching I start seeing an overwhelming number of people waiting in line.

I tell myself this must it and promptly park and get my election energies going. I'm walking by a few people and I ask where the line starts and they point back to me behind a building. I was in shock at the amount of people ""out to vote"" and was largely impressed by how everyone had their masks on. 

I talk a few people here and there but obviously for any number of reasons i don't need to verbalize here I keep my political leanings to myself and go on chatting them up about everything other than politics. 

I meet a nice fella named Dave who I confused to be Caucasian American with blue eyes but was really Mexican and fully takes advantage of how he's perceived as seen with his interactions with others and Susan a sweet shy girl that I could tell is usually very abrasive and standoffish to anyone approaching her, but we are here in line for the common goal of ""voting"" and we're able to build conversation and have some laughs.

3 hours have now passed by and in this time I have seen dozens of people come and go not wanting to stand under the sun, I tell Dave that if he want to go get water to go ahead, I would save his spot. As we're approaching the entrance to the ""polling stations"" I start smelling rich delicious cinnamon and start seeing people walk out with cinnamon rolls and it finally dawns on me....All these people and my wait for almost 4 hours was all for cinnamon rolls from a place called Knaus Berry Farms...

Immediately left that place feeling embarrassed but at the same time kind of like, ""well that's a story for you to share now and maybe people will laugh with you rather than at you haha"". Called my coworker and explained everything that had happened - he laughed so hard and so proper that it actually gave me a chuckle myself and he then became Q to my bumbling 007 and led me to a proper polling location. It took me less than 5 minutes from parking to get setup at a station and fill my vote.

American Express in Miami is suing Mexican singer Paulina Rubio for non-payment. According to the legal document, presented on the Mexican program Ventaneando, the lawsuit was filed for uncovered credits amounting to an amount of $28,622.40 USD according to the file that has been processed in a civil court in Miami, Florida, dated October 28, 2020. 

It should taken into consideration that Paulina Rubio, at 49 years old, currently has various financial responsibilities: she is in charge of the maintenance of her house and her two children, Andrea Nicol√°s and Eros, she must also comply with the pension Alimony that she gives to her ex-husband, Nicol√°s Vallejo N√°gera, for almost $7,000 USD a month and, in addition, must pay professional fees to her respective lawyers.

This lawsuit adds to the long legal battle she has with Vallejo N√°gera for the custody of her son, since the couple decided to divorce in 2014, after seven years of relationship.

Politics, subcultures, dialects, cultural and religious influences and so on. Miami is a city that has always intrested me, up there with LA, NYC and ATL. The reason why that is, is that in Italy, or at least in my social cirle, we see Florida and Miami as this paradise of sunshine and seaside. 

That really bugs my mind tho, since as far as I know most East Coast cities - or cities in the US for that matter (especially  in the south) - have very deeprooted subcultures, with relative neighborhoods, where people live differently. 

Now I'm watching a series set in Miami (StartUp), that gives out a very strong idea on how corrupted the whole city is, on how hard life is in places like Little Haiti, and on how forein communities (Haitians, Cubans, Russians, Chineses etc.) have a strong influence on cultural and financial aspect of the city.

This is in strong contrast with the idea I previously had on the city and the things I've been able to dig in the internet so far.

So my question is: how does it all tie together, how is it like? I'd love to hear especially from people that work in the estate market or have other kinds of connections with the most amount of subcolture possible. Of course if anyone watched the series, I'd like to know directly if the criminal aspect of the city is exagerated.

This photograph was taken sometime between 1910 and 1920. It shows the Miami River at 27th Avenue. Today, this area is a concrete jungle; back then, it was the beginning of the Everglades. Miami developers had long dreamed of draining the swamp to open up vast quantities of land that had been impossible to farm or build upon. To the right is the drainage canal that helped to realize that dream. Once the canal was completed and the retention dam was removed the water from the Everglades began to drain into Biscayne Bay. According to one local, the water ""flowed like a torrent"" for weeks. It had the intended effect of turning the swamp into dry land, which allowed the communities of Hialeah, Miami Springs, and Opa Locka to come into being -- but the project was not without its unintended consequences. As is often the case when humans attempt to reconfigure the environment, nature hit back. During dry spells, the usually wet soil of the Everglades referred to as ""muck"" dried up and cracked, and the sawgrass caught fire spreading choking smoke throughout the newly settled land. During wet periods, the area flooded easily and residents needed boats to get around. Drainage and water management would be, and remains, a constant theme in the history of Miami's development. It is our blessing and our curse. Without it, Miami would not exist as we know it today. But done without principles of conservation in mind and we risk decimating the delicate balance of nature's own water management system that took South Florida thousands of years to create.

This photo shows the Car Dale observation tower at Musa Isle, a popular tourist attraction at the time just east of 27th Avenue. Adjoining it was a Seminole village that also hosted visitors. The steamer seen in the picture is the Lady Lou, which took tourists on a round trip tour of the Miami River starting from Avenue D (today's Miami Avenue bridge).

So recently I started a website called [Firefly List](https://www.fireflylist.com/miami/) to send out all the flight deals I come by out of Miami &amp; the Fort Lauderdale area. I've travelled a bunch and figured I could set up a way to share the deals I discovered. Full disclosure, it's a freemium list, so it's totally free but has an option to upgrade.

It's grown quite a bit and has been super fun to work on.

That said, COVID has definitely changed the dynamic of things in the travel space, if you're interested, you can see how we're addressing that [here.](https://www.fireflylist.com/covid/) One positive is that it's forced me to look into domestic options. Originally I strictly sent out international deals but many domestic flights even 5-7 months out from today are heavily reduced with airlines offering change fee waivers. So I started tracking domestic routes as well - which is also free btw.

**Airports I track in the Miami area:** Miami International (MIA) &amp; Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport (FLL)

**Some of the past round trip deals I've found &amp; sent out:**

$301 to Rome &amp; Athens Greece

$242 to Costa Rica

$355 to Tokyo, Japan

$356 to Kauai, Hawaii

I was wondering what kind of destinations you guys would like to see out of Miami/Fort Lauderdale area?

1724,1603058115,"I recently moved to Miami and it blows me away that there are so many Latinx Trump voters. I've learned that in particular, there is a lot of Cuban support for Trump. This makes no sense to me, and I'm looking to have a civil conversation with someone who fits this description and is willing to explain their rationale. 

I get that many Cubans are opposed to anybody and anything that is even remotely suggestive of socialism and communism. The Right has done a great job of trying to depict Biden and Kamala as socialists. I disagree with this completely, but whatever, I understand how people who have fled from Cuba may have fears of even remotely socialist policies. 

What I don't understand is how people who were so against the Castro dictatorship can be supportive of a president (Trump) who attacks the opposing side so vehemently. He has threatened to jail his opponents. Anybody that disagrees with him is ripped to shreds and touted as ""fake news"". After the FBI stopped 8 domestic terrorists from kidnapping the Michigan governor, Trump was recently filmed at a rally laughing as his supporters chanted, ""lock her up,"" referring to this same governor.  And don't even get me started on voting. Trump has repeatedly tried to cast doubt on our electoral process, and one can only assume he is doing this so that if he doesn't like the results of the election, he has a ""reason"" to not comply.

Published in the Miami Herald 100 years ago today was this humorous poem about the high cost of rent. The People ask Rent whether it intends to go up that year. They know that the upcoming tourist season will provide Landlords with the opportunity to hike up their prices. Despite pleas by the People that they will be forced into homelessness and thrown into the sea, the Rent remained indifferently silent. In true fat cat fashion, the Landlords callously concluded that the People can afford the higher Rent by spending less on clothes. ""Let them tan nude!"" said Miami's early 20th century housing proprietors, putting on their best Marie Antoinette impressions.  


They say the more things change the more they stay the same -- with respect to rent in Miami it seems like it's just the latter.",100 Years Ago Today...,1603053852.0

Thought I'd share my findings with you fine folks since I know this is always a tough one for us laypeople. And of course if this leads to any thoughtful discussion of our judiciary on this sub that can only be healthy.

The Supreme Court judge on the Ballot, Carlos Mu√±iz, a member of the Federalist Society, was appointed by DeSantis and was among those who has [ruled in favor](https://www.floridasupremecourt.org/content/download/567884/opinion/sc19-1341.pdf) of his efforts to undermine Amendment 4 - yes that amendment, the one we all overwhelmingly voted for in 2018.

I'm not a lawyer so it took me a little bit of effort to parse through and figure out what the hell the 3rd District Court of Appeals even is (as opposed to all the various other courts). Basically the 3rd District is Florida's state appellate court that covers Miami-Dade and the Keys. It is the last chance for the vast majority of defendants from our community. Every single one of our appellate judges on the ballot was appointed by either Scott or DeSantis. Many seem to be members of the Federalist Society. Moreover, I came across [this fascinating article](https://at4h71.blogspot.com/2020/09/making-case-to-vote-no-on-all-florida.html), which discusses the rampant abuse of a mechanism called *Per Curium Affirmed* (PCA) by these appellate judges, which basically allows them to summarily deny people their last shot at a trial without giving any explanation whatsoever. This is how they are dealing with 3 out of 4 cases they hear.

But the clincher for me is that after all this, I was able to get the opinion of a former Miami Public Defender, as well as a director of a national civil rights organization who is local to Miami. You know, people who actually know what they're talking about. Both also recommend voting NO on every judge, with one exception: **They recommend voting to retain [appellate Judge Eric Hendon](https://ballotpedia.org/Eric_Hendon)**. I take it they feel the guy has shown significant fairness in his rulings.

Anyway that's how I'm voting. I hope some of you find it helpful. But no matter where you stand, PLEASE JUST FUCKING VOTE!",Why I'm voting NO on (almost) every Florida judge on the ballot.,1602643024.0

The photo above is an article written 100 years ago today in the Miami Herald. Miami was in the middle of a dispute that would be familiar to anyone who uses Uber or Lyft today. Back then, jitneys, which are private cars or buses for hire, would transport people to and from Miami Beach. Apparently, the city was attempting to require operators to be licensed. The article notes that many jitney patrons were upset at the measure, which reduced the number of jitneys and forced them to walk to the beach or stay home.

You may notice a lack of Black people in these photos. This is because by the 1920s Black Miamians were prohibited from all public beaches. Prior to 1919, the only beach open to Blacks was located on the island we know today as Fisher Island, which was owned by local Black real estate mogul Dana A. Dorsey. In 1919, Dorsey sold the Island to Carl Fisher, and Black Miamians were effectively landlocked, prohibited from all public beaches, for another 25 years. It was not until Virginia Key Beach was established as a Black-only beach in 1945 after a series of local ‚Äúwade-ins‚Äù and protests that the Black community could again legally access a public beach in Miami.","Some pictures of Miami Beach from the 1920s, and an article from the Miami Herald discussing a city crackdown on the Uber-before-there-was-Uber",1602454563.0

I want to know what the reasoning is for this besides fear of communism. I understand that left wing politics resembles socialist policies more so than the right and this can be triggering for people like my father, uncles etc. Im not denying their fear, if that is the basis of why they vote republican every time then so be it. 

But besides that, is there something I don‚Äôt know?

You look up authentic Cuban picadillo recipes on the internet and almost every single one has raisins in the ingredients. I've even had spaghetti with raisins in Mexico (this is relevant).

My soon-to-be extremely unpopular theory is this: People who hate raisins in picadillo have Anglicized and Americanized taste buds.  Nothing wrong with that, but I have a hunch that people, such as myself, who LIKE raisins in picadillo are more traditionally ethnic in their food tastes.  It's very common in America to react with disgust to things like olives, raisins, and chewy sweet things in their food.  Not so much in other countries though.  I grew up eating empanadas with raisins, so it's normal to me.  But my wife, who is 110% Gringa, hates raisins and olives in her picadillo, empanadas, and everything else.  

I await my downvotes, but seriously, I think raisin-haters' taste buds have been Americanized.  That's my theory.","I might get downvoted to hell, but I have a theory on why raisins in picadillo seems to be unpopular in Miami.",1602200326.0

Amendment 4 is written in plain English, and it‚Äôs plain bad. It would require that future amendments proposed to the state constitution be approved by voters in two elections ‚Äî instead of one, as is currently required. Why should the voters have to say it twice?

The Florida Constitution provides three basic methods for originating amendments ‚Äî through the Legislature, a statewide commission or a citizen initiative. Amendments must be approved by at least 60 percent of the voters to be adopted. [Amendment 4](https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/initiatives/initdetail.asp?account=74114&amp;seqnum=2) requires all future proposed amendments to be approved by the voters in two elections. The current thresholds for passage still apply in each of the two elections, and the requirement would apply to all amendments regardless of how they originate.

If this is a good idea, how come nobody does it? A Florida legislative staff analysis in December found that Nevada was the only state that required two elections, and that standard applied only to citizen-led initiatives. Voters in North Dakota will decide a similar measure in the Nov. 3 general election.

Backers say the amendment will keep the constitution from becoming cluttered. But there already are high hurdles for placing an amendment on the ballot; proposals by the Legislature need support by three-fifths of the membership, revision commissions meet only every 20 years and citizens' initiatives face a host of financial and logistical barriers. Lawmakers also routinely ignore amendments that Florida voters approve (see: Conservation Lands, Felons' Voting Rights). This is just another tool for the ruling class to remain unanswerable and out-of-touch. The *Times* Editorial Board recommends a **No vote on Amendment 4.**

2104,1601823303,"100 Years Ago Today: The commentary below comes from the October 4, 1920 edition of the Miami Herald. It responds to an editorial in the same edition that called for the rebuilding of a robust Republican party in Miami. At this time, almost 45 years since the official end of reconstruction, Miami (and the rest of the state) was dominated by the Democratic party. Many in the south viewed the Republican party with suspicion, particularly because it was still the favored party of black Americans. The editorial that was printed elsewhere in the same edition was attempting to convince Miamians that they had nothing to fear from a Republican party, because blacks in Miami were modest and reserved, and in any event, didn‚Äôt actually make up a large part of republicans in Miami. It closed by arguing that Miami ‚Äúwould be greatly benefited by the presence of a second white man‚Äôs party.‚Äù The commentary we below responded to the editorial with high levels of suspicion and not so subtle racism. Its main argument goes some like: try as they might, the Republican party cannot rid itself of its black voters. The title alone speaks volumes: ‚ÄúTHEY ALSO RECOGNIZE THE DANGER.‚Äù Of course, the racist subtext of this back and forth is the treatment of the black vote as a liability. The commentary also casts black voters as ‚Äúheretofore indifferent,‚Äù a characterization that is far from the truth, and ignores the sordid reality of black voter suppression in the Jim Crow era. We don‚Äôt often think of Miami as being a ‚Äúsouthern town,‚Äù but before the large influx of immigrants from the Caribbean and Central and South America completely changed the face of our city, there is no question that Miami was just that. As we head full speed into the thick of the presidential election season, this brief glance at Miami‚Äôs past is a reminder that we must all vote, and make our voices heard.

I've lived in my condo for 15 years (I own) and with this dog for 5 years. Recently had an older couple move down the hall and across from us and I believe they're renting. We spend 98% of our time at home as we both work from home and rarely go out at this point in our lives. On 3 different occasions we've had a note about our dog barking while we were gone. 2 notes were left during the day on a weekend and one on a Saturday night because we went to dinner at 8pm and were home by 10pm. 

I dont know what to do. The dog is small and old, and has clearly developed anxiety which our vet said is very prevalent right now with people staying home. We have bought a little thunder jacket, pheromone spray, a camera and even got anti anxiety medication that seems to work* from the vet. 

*but we dont want to drug our dog anytime we literally run to the supermarket or lunch so of course we didnt administer the pill today and came home to a note. 

The dog barks while we are gone, but without as much bias as possible I have to say...its not constant. It's not even that bad.She just barks if she hears something. And if we give her the medicine she doesnt bark at all.

I know posts like these are one sided because naturally people would assume this is egregious and all but its really not. We are always home and doing everything we can short of just killing the poor dog. It seems like our neighbor is harassing us at this point and without warning just firing up another note. I can understand a weeknight. I could even understand 10pm being late. But that isnt the case. We were gone today from 12 to 1 and a note appeared. 

We emailed our property manager and he basically tried to tell us not to stress and that it isnt a big deal but how can someone not stress if the notes are becoming more threatening? What if these assholes call the cops and a cop shows up while we arent home?

Has anyone had experience similar to this? I appreciate any input.",Dog barking in condo when we arent home,1601765982.0

We've already been to the PAMM, the Rubell, the Wolfson, the Bass, and MOCA. I'm not opposed to going to any of these again, they're all great in their own way, but we'd really love something a little off the beaten path. Any suggestions, Miami?

Now, while I get the sub position/policy in normal times and am totally OK with it,  I don't see the issue in loosening up a bit at least until the election season is over.  

Particularly an election season that is turning out to be  one of the most consequential of probably all of our lifetimes.  

And while I also understand that there are dedicated subreddits for political discussion, it is simply not the same.   

My argument would be that  ""all politics is eventually local"" and since I live in South Florida, I like to discuss the political issues of the day with my neighbors in South Florida, i.e. those of us who share this city and are affected by what the pols that pretend to represent us (at the local, state and federal levels) are doing.  

Finally, while I also understand that the mods want to avoid ""the shouting matches"" when the Trump supporters come on here to debate and it gets rowdy with the back and forth, to that I say:  so what?    

We are all adults here, and as long as we are not completely abusive assholes to each other, we should be able to have our back and forth and make our points, and hopefully be persuasive.  

Hopefully you'll reconsider, and you have my promise not to be as ""passionate"" going forward and to keep the snarkiness in check.     

I also hope that others who share this view will also make the commitment to argue their points in a respectful way.

I‚Äôm a medical student coming to volunteer at Kendall Regional Medical Center (KRMC) for the next month. I was fortunate to receive this opportunity to help with the pandemic and further my training as a future physician. As mandated by my medical school, I received negative COVID test before leaving for my trip. I also plan on taking all the safety and social distancing precautions when I get down there.

To limit my costs, I plan on staying at a family-friend's empty apartment in Brickell. I plan on taking the MetroRail + Bus (40B) daily to arrive at the hospital at 6:45 am.

From what I‚Äôve read on this sub so far, there are not a lot of good reviews/experiences with the Miami public transportation system (specifically the bus). Do you think I‚Äôd be able to do this commute and reliably arrive to work on time?

I‚Äôd like to avoid the expense and hassle of a car. I mainly care about arriving to work on time. I‚Äôm okay with losing/wasting extra time on my commute back home (KRMC to Brickell). I‚Äôm hoping the early morning commute combined with a general reduction in commuter traffic (d/t COVID WFM culture) would make this commute possible.

I would appreciate any/all feedback. Thank you for your time and input. I look forward to coming down there, learning as much as I can, and serving the Miami community!

To limit my costs, I plan on staying at a family-friend's empty apartment in Brickell. I plan on taking the MetroRail + Bus (40B - SW 152 Ave) daily to arrive at the hospital at 6:45 am.

From what I‚Äôve read on this sub so far, there are not a lot of good reviews/experiences with the Miami public transportation system (specifically the bus). Do you think I‚Äôd be able to do this commute and reliably arrive to work on time?

I‚Äôd like to avoid the expense and hassle of a car. I mainly care about arriving to work on time. I‚Äôm okay with losing/wasting extra time on my commute back home (KRMC to Brickell). I‚Äôm hoping the early morning commute combined with a general reduction in commuter traffic (d/t COVID WFM culture) would make this commute possible.

I would appreciate any/all feedback. Thank you for your time and input. I look forward to coming down there, learning as much as I can, and helping the Miami community!

September 27, 1920. This Miami Herald commentary sheds some light on just how long Miami has been grappling with the issue of public transportation. Very early on in Miami‚Äôs history the city had a fairly extensive network of street trolleys that went from Miami Beach, through downtown Miami, to as far west as where Marlins Park sits today. In fact, the large median on Coral Way just east of Miracle Mile (where those huge banyan trees are) used to be tracks for one of the early street car systems. Miami would eventually settle on buses at its main mode of mass transit until the 80s, when the Metrorail was built. Given the increasing density of the urban core, and the advent of rising seas, what do you think the future of mass transit will look like in Miami? The second photo is a humorous quip from the writers at the Herald that I think we can all still relate to today. And really? Alligators are considered mailable? Is that still true?!

&amp;#x200B;

I really like UMiami and I've been told that I might be competitive for merit scholarships there. That's the only way I would go to the school because I'm from Texas and have been accepted to UT Austin which is cheap in comparison.

&amp;#x200B;

But I've heard a lot of mixed things about UMiami as a school. I've heard a lot of people refer to it as a rich party school/for sheltered rich kids and idk how I feel about that. I'm solidly middle class, like I've had a job since I was 14 and stuff and I wouldn't consider myself sheltered. Do any of y'all have experience with the school? How does that reputation hold up? And how do people from Miami generally look at the school? I'm interested in living in Miami as an adult, do most people from the school settle in Miami after graduation?

My Spanish is also pretty bad (my family is Cuban but I never really picked it up). Will that be an issue living in Miami?

2340,1600960635,"Hello, I was inspired by a post, by someone years ago on this sub and I wanted to add my post here. 

I pretty much lived in Miami my whole life, I had some good memories, but most of it was bad. My parents abused me and my mother abandoned me here when I was 11. I was bullied a lot here. I really don't have any friends here and  I struggle a lot in this city, when I left to go to school in Boca, I loved it but I was too worried about coming back to Miami and guess what, I ended up back in here. That was 5 years ago, now I'm about to graduate but these past few years have been very transformative and traumatic. My father passed away this year, and his ex wife (who I realized quickly after she left that she was abusing me for 15 years) abandoned him. I took care of him until the day he died. I survived abuse, and I'm ready to move on with my life. I was held back most of my life. 


For years I have always planned on leaving Miami, because the economy here is crap, most people are hostile, traffic and because I wanted a fresh start somewhere new. I don't really have any family here and for years that I had this overwhelming feeling that I don't belong/never belonged in Miami. That became the source of my loneliness. 

As for family, I don't have any here, I didn't have a girlfriend or any significant relationships here either. I have family friends and they're supportive but that's pretty much it. 

I have been seeing a therapist for a while and I have been making progress, I'm in a much better place than I was than 6 months to  a year ago, I'm still struggling with the fact my father is gone although he abused me and I'm also struggling with the loneliness here. 

I have the feeling that there's nothing left for me in this city anymore, so that's a factor why I'm leaving. Did anyone here have this feeling? I'm just asking for some opinions and guidance. 

With that being said, I love Miami and I hate Miami, I'll miss the bakeries, food and the beach and the weather.

Many of you will disagree with me on what I have to say next.  Joe Biden, and the Democratic Party are not socialists.  They are a centrist party, mainly center-right.  The fact is that many of the policies that the Republican Party and the Democratic Party have had over the years - that have benefitted you and your families - are ""socialist"" in nature.  When the first wave of Cubans came to this country and especially to Florida, they received massive taxpayer-funded government assistance (i.e., ""socialism""), and I've yet to hear of a single Cuban who turned it down.  Free money.  Free housing.  Free health care.  Free job training.  Free language classes.  Free food.  Free eyeglasses.  All paid for by American taxpayers.  Did this turn America into a socialist country?  Are you a socialist now?  Or was that kind of ""socialism"" OK because you benefitted personally?  

The second thing I have to say is that in America, as a centrist democracy, we have always had a mix of so-called ""socialist"" and free-market policies.  No Republican has ever turned down ""socialist"" Social Security, ""socialist"" farm subsidies, ""socialist"" Medicare and Medicaid, ""socialist"" public education from kindergarten all the way to PhD, ""socialist"" food stamps and EBT, ""socialist"" TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), ""socialist"" SSI (Supplemental Security Income), ""socialist"" military benefits, and the list goes on. 

What Americans have turned down, whether they be Republicans or Democrats - until now - is  authoritarianism.  I will submit to you that Trump is the very definition of an authoritarian, and you would do well to reject him, as you have rejected Castro, Chavez, and Maduro.  These people are/were lawless dictators, extremists, and authoritarians.  You don't fight a dictatorship by replacing it with another dictatorship.  You don't fight extremism by voting for another extremist.  

There's so much more I could say here but I don't want this to be another tl;dr, so if anyone has anything to add, please do.

I‚Äôm new to Miami from New York. I‚Äôm a professional female in my early 30‚Äôs and work (mostly) from home. 

I always rented in NY so while I‚Äôm not crazy about paying HOA fees it does seem to make sense for me to buy a condo down here rather than rent so at least I‚Äôm not throwing AS MUCH money in the garbage. 

I have pretty much narrowed it down to a 1 bedroom unit in the Centro Building- I love that it has a water view, the unit I like is on the 30th floor and has really high ceilings. I like the amenities in the building and I don‚Äôt have a car so parking isn‚Äôt an issue. Although the building offers valet and there is a lot across the street for $150 if I decide to get one in the future. It‚Äôs priced at $295,000 owner wants to move quickly so I‚Äôd like to get it for under $270,000. 

I also saw a unit in One Miami which is similarly priced. I don‚Äôt like the unit as much which is a drag bc I‚Äôll be working from there but the location is incredible and it has parking and a great reputation. It‚Äôs priced at $310,000 and doesn‚Äôt seem to be as much negotiation room. 

Would love to hear if anyone has thoughts good or bad on either of the buildings and their potential rentability. 

Also I understand a single family home might be a better investment but I‚Äôm really not looking to buy a house right now and prefer the security and amenities that a building offers. 

Really appreciate any info you can provide!  Thank you in advance!",Would love your opinion on a condo downtown,1600287255.0

The condo is amazing! It's on the 32nd floor, has a fully renovated kitchen, built-in closets, and is inside of Brickell's only gated community. Rent includes cable, internet, and water/sewage. Right in the heart of Downtown Miami/Brickell. If you'd like a video tour of the place, here's one of a 3BR unit with a slightly different layout than the 2BR unit for this post: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjdoYOd6L7rAhViu1kKHZxzB-kQtwIwAnoECAEQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DcCwRnKGIKwU&amp;usg=AOvVaw1RQHqTCgTwOyNb_pD1SM-A

3035,1598376844,"Please help. My dad passed away due to COVID a bit over a month ago. We were just told by friends yesterday to look into the deed of the house to make sure my mom's name was on it. I thought it was silly because they bought the apartment together when they were already married but it turns out whoever sold it to my dad listed him as single and my mom's name is nowhere on the paperwork. We were told we'd need an attorney to change the owner of the apartment to my mom and not have to worry about our home being taken from us. I've called a few lawyers but their hourly rates are insane and I've also applied to the Miami-dade legal help but they said they don't do these kinds of cases and referred us to ""Dade legal, put something back"" program but they haven't gotten back to me yet. Does anyone on here know of any -affordable- attorneys who know how to fix this? We can't afford to pay 350/hr or anything like that.

This man was part of operation Pedro pan, just like my grandma and her brother were. Basically, the US gov supported the Catholic Church in a propaganda campaign after the revolution. They told parents that Castro would take their kids and send them to re-education camps to be indoctrinated. So parents instead shipped then to the US to be placed in a re-education camp run by the Catholic Church. I know a few others due to my grandparents growing up in these camps, they are all brainwashed conservatives. The idea is you take the kids, teach them the language, and instill the proper conservative ideals into them. Then, if you're able to, bring their family over who likely doesn't speak English. Family then had to rely on their children as a guide to America and the kids instill these values into them. When later immigrants come, they rely on people who are already there to help integrate and the cycle continues. The children in these camps have an advantage over other Cuban immigrants and are able to get better jobs and have access to better opportunities than other immigrants, which is why you usually see those that survived the camps in a good position. This helps reinforce the ideal of the American dream to those in the factories of Hialeah.

From personal experience with the products of these camps they don't understand what happen in the revolution and have a warped view if reality. They mostly came from well to do families who benefited from the the dictatorship prior to Castro. They no idea about the issues that plagued Cuba that lead to the revolution because they were young when they left and the only info they got was from the people that ran these camps. My grandma, for example, thinks segregation is a solution to racial tensions because it worked in Cuba.

3043,1598365906,"Good morning everyone,

I grew up in Florida, living in Jacksonville and Orlando for the first 28 years of my life. I moved to Georgia for the last 6 years, and several weeks ago was offered a job in Miami. I moved into a nice duplex in Biscayne Park.

My AC simply cannot get below 73¬∫. I'm not used to this at all. During the morning and first break of afternoon it stays around 73¬∫. Though at night, my AC stays at 77-80¬∫ no matter what I've set it to, from 5pm until 4am. So I'm basically living in a sauna, sweating bullets, smelling like BO, incapable of concentrating, and feeling like a slow cooked chicken. My landlord told me to never set the AC below 75¬∫. Ugh.

He also tells me there's nothing wrong with the AC. He sent a repairman out who also said as much.

Is this normal? I've never lived in a residence in Florida where 1) the expectation was just to live in a hot house, and 2) the AC was consistently hotter ALL NIGHT, and cool in the morning. 

I'm wondering if I have any grounds to complain, any leg to stand on, or if I'm expected to eventually bake into a cooked chicken one night, and be eaten alive by my dog the next morning.

Thank you.

(p.s. my office at work, which is 5 minutes away, is for sure setting the ac in the sixties and it's a paradise).",Question about AC and landlord expectations,1598380306.0

If that wasn‚Äôt enough parents are currently going through a divorce so safe to say, she‚Äôs having a really tough time. 

She had only one request in the last day for her birthday and I‚Äôm really trying to make it happen within a budget and short time constraint. I found a cake baker I would happily give all my money to if possible but it was pretty over budget by $40-50 and wanted to see if anyone had any recommendations for other cake bakers who may be available/work within that budget (I was hoping $80 and understand that means it has to be much simpler!)

She basically wants a seashell/mermaid/ocean inspired ombr√© cake that has an oyster or pearls on it. Specific kid, lol. Again she can‚Äôt have friends or anyone over so this is for like 4 people and can be a miniature cake or cupcakes even! I will also be talking to the person I contacted to see what she could do within my budget because I sent some inspiration pictures which were way more intricate than necessary but figured I would post here as well.

I have some ideas that will take some time, but in the meantime could you give me the good, the bad, and the ugly? Any ideas or requests are welcome. Its been a while since I have been back and I feel out of touch, whats the vibe like these days? What artwork are people loving?

P.S. I am not a graphic designer, I am more of a compiler and producer than anything. I use graphic design apps to tweak things and I have begun dabbling in actual design but I am no pro. If you want the info for any of the artists let me know.

3096,1598125902,"I moved here (South Beach) in 2008 and have lived in South of Fifth neighborhood ever since.

The first years were great. The period of 2008-2013 is very vivid in my mind and represents some of the best years of my life. South Beach was classy and upscale, popular but not crowded, festive but not obnoxiously noisy. It had a unique atmosphere that I can barely describe: A fusion of latin and South European culture with remnants of the 80s and 90s. It felt like a very unique place. Great restaurants (Nemo, Escopazzo, China Grill, Khong River House), art galleries, brunch cafes, juice bars, arthouse cinema..

2014 is when things started to change for the worse. AirBnB arrived and with it, one could see an immediate change in the tourist demographics. More crowds, more noise, Ocean Drive slowly morphing into a circus, the smell of weed at night becoming more prevalent. If one dared look towards the future, the signs of degeneration and decay were all encompassing. I wondered then how long it'd take for the transformation to complete.

2016 onwards and all my favorite restaurants have closed. I've witnessed multiple shootings that took place in broad daylight, in some of the most central and crowded places on the beach. Washington Avenue is derelict with 2$ pizza, cheap souvenir shops and tattoo parlors. The upscale shop area of Collins is devastated. The streets smell like urine. 

2020 and the transformation is complete. Ghetto thugs roam the streets day or night. Crime rates have drastically increased. All one can hear is cRap music being blasted from cars cruising down Ocean Drive. In the early hours of the morning, there are car races and so much noise that can make your windows rattle. Gone are the high class European tourists, replaced by endless waves of loud, obnoxious, obese blacks in various stages of undress that smoke weed and behave like zoo animals.

I sped up even more to get in front of him and I got to the light which turned red but the idiot tripped with his bike wheelie. Mind you, he was plenty of feet behind me and had time to stop. I would say two-three cars behind. 

But gets mad at me. So then him and his buddy decide to smack my car and windows and the tripped dude breaks my right view mirror. I tried to chase him to get his plate and he rides off. Buddy then comes and slighlty cracks my driver door window with his hand. 

The rest of the group were already ahead so I didn‚Äôt have to deal with them.

I call police but they said that without the plate, there is nothing they can do. The cop that came did say that they are usually driving down that road every sunday. I haven‚Äôt driven down okeechobe on sundays after that.

I'm looking to move within the next 2-3 months. Budget is $2200ish,  of course the lower the better without sacrificing too much quality or space, I can also go up a little if it's worth it.

Looking for either something in Brickell, downtown, or Omni, Town Square, or whatever that area is called now. Preferably within walking distance to the mover or metrorail.

Building construction. I don't want to hear every time my neighbor takes a piss.

The higher off the street, the better. Ideally like 25th floor or higher would be nice.

So just wanted to give you an update on the procedure for dropping off a mail-in ballot with an election official if you don't want to mail it with all this ""Trump fucking with the USPS business"" 

Background: 

1. I dropped off 6 mail-in ballot envelopes at an early voting location yesterday afternoon.  My ballot, my wife's, my in-laws, and my sister in law's ballot.  I went alone. 
2. As an experiment, I had my mom mail hers in early last week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Result: 

* My mom's ballot showed up as ""counted"" on the County elections website 3 days after she mailed it in.  
* When I went to the Elections Drop Box there was a County representative who collected the ballots; 
* I was asked to provide my Driver's License. 
* She verified my address versus what was shown on the envelopes, and compared the signature on my DL to that on my ballot.  
* For my envelope that I handed in person, it was stamped ""SELF"" next to my signature. 
* For my inlaws and my wife, since she did not come in person, and my inlaws did not come in person or live in the same address - she made a notation on the ballot itself by their signature - and then she had a list where she recorded their name, the name of the person who dropped off the ballot for them, the person's relationship to the signatories, along with both our addresses and phone numbers.  

I will monitor the website to see how long it takes to be counted, but I figure it should take no more than a day or two.  

In any case, it was a pretty thorough process and seems like a system that would be much harder to fuck with than a hacker breaking into a voting system or a crooked voting machine maker that would allow a mass tweaking of a few thousand votes to swing an election.",Miami-Dade Elections - Dropping off a Mail-In Ballot with a County Elections Official Instead of Mailing - How it goes down...,1597604455.0

Just got a job offer and they're asking me to decide tomorrow between Philadelphia and Miami - I am struggling greatly with the decision. For background, I'm 23, male, and single. My favorite hobbies are hiking and watching sports and my office would be in Plantation, FL. Would also love to know what area's of the city or South Florida in general would be good to live in for someone my age! 

The pro's I have for Miami are

* Hispanic culture - I speak great Spanish and love the culture.
* fun night life scene
* cheap flights to South/Central America and Caribbean
* beach

The con's I have for Miami are

* expensive, maybe a bit materialistic?
* have to drive everywhere

Feel free to add to my pro's and con's. Thanks for your help",Miami or Philadelphia,1597337684.0

I was originally planning to move to the south of fifth area in Miami (the only area I know well) but decided against apartment living in favor of a house given the current situation and likely long term work from home status.

I have a very young child so good elementary schools (nearby) and safety are a major consideration, I‚Äôd prefer to be able to walk to at least some restaurants and not be too far from a beach (maybe &lt;20 minute drive). House budget is up to $1.5m for a 3 or 4 bedroom. I‚Äôve looked online at houses and morningside has some historic ones that are more my taste and looks like has a nice park for the kid but says its a ‚Äúgated area,‚Äù which I don‚Äôt really understand as it looks like ~10 blocks?  And I know nothing else about it. Surfside looks close to the beach but something just seems off there based on reasonable prices so close to the beach (maybe I‚Äôm wrong?). I read posts recommending coral gables to others, but can you walk to anything there? And it seems a bit away from the beach.

....

While the Covid-19 pandemic slowed business for most restaurants, one popular staple in South Florida struggles with a welcomed problem: keeping up with demand.

Flanigan's CEO James Flanigan said curbside business is booming at the popular seafood chain despite Miami-Dade County's restrictions on indoor dining. He added his restaurants are aggressively hiring to keep up with consistent curbside to-go orders.


The company had to pivot in the face of the pandemic, Flanigan added, but the brand name carried the company through the pandemic's hardships on the hospitality industry.

He said it's not uncommon to see a line of cars wrapped around the restaurant waiting for food during dinner hours.

‚ÄúI think our customers enjoyed turning us into a Chick-fil-a and have the lines wrapping around the block,"" Flanigan said. ""There's a novelty to that.""

The company's locations are currently generating about 72% of the sales they would normally do this time of year, he said. While that is not ideal, it's substantially better than most food and beverage concepts in the region, where sales have been down more than 50% in some areas.


Flanigan said he believes the company could be performing better if not for 10 p.m. curfews, restrictions on bar service and indoor seating restrictions.

When Flanigan's Enterprises Inc.'s (NYSE: BDL) restaurants were allowed to operate at 50% indoor capacity in June, he said the eateries generated about 93% of their normal sales volume.

The high volume of sales, added to the $13.1 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funds secured for about two dozen locations, were enough to keep the business secure through the uncertainty of the pandemic and keep about 90% of the company's 2,000 workers employed, he said.

""For us, PPP worked exactly as intended,"" Flanigan said. ‚ÄúOnce I knew I could get some help, I said, ‚ÄòKeep these people working no matter what.‚Äô‚Äù

The company's success waned when stricter regulations were put in place as Covid-19 cases spiked in the region for a second time in early July. Flanigan said his restaurants are still at capacity working within the restrictions.

Despite the steady flow of revenue, Flanigan said curbside sales do not offset the additional costs associated with takeout operations given the size of the kitchens and the staff needed. Flanigan's restaurants are only able to generate about 60% of their normal sales volume through takeout orders, he said. Flanigan's does not offer delivery.


Flanigan said his biggest long-term concern is how this pandemic will impact casual dine-in restaurants post-Covid. The chain has plans to open locations in Sunrise, Miramar and Davie, but the design of those new restaurants might look different should Flanigan's make curbside service more of a focal point in the years to come.

Flanigan added he'll have to make more permanent changes to all locations in order to keep up with the demand for curbside orders, depending on the long term effects.",Flanigans is leading the restaurant industry in post COVID sales,1596856241.0

The reason I want to recommend this site specifically is because I have gone to it a number of times and had extremely positive experiences. There is never a line, and the amount of time from submitting my contact info to getting my brain poked has ranged from 11 minutes to 4. I also have consistently received results from this site within 5 days or earlier. 

I have heard a lot of horror stories about lines and long wait times for results from other test sites. Additionally, my first test was at the Miami Beach Convention Center. The site was run by soldiers in fatigues with aggressive attitudes, and with shitty ""beside manner."" One of them made a subtly racist comment about the fact I was speaking English (as opposed to the Spanish speakers he was sick and tired of translating for). When I had the swab shoved up my nasal cavity, I gagged/yelped-in-shock a little, and the entire crew audibly chuckled. It was embarassing/weird/negative.  

The site at 73 and Collins is non-military nurses that have been consistently kind and act like medical professionals. Also, their zone for doing the actual test is purposefully obscured, so you're not getting brain poked with an audience (that might also laugh at you).

The main reason for my frequent testing = I am still physically going in to work and have had a number of possible exposures + want to make sure I am not positive asymptomatic and spreading it to coworkers. Just to add at the end here, I think as Florida continues to spiral, everyone getting tested as frequently as they are able is a Best Practice.",Quick/easy Covid test site recommendation in Miami Beach,1596739980.0

I‚Äôm here because unfortunately I‚Äôve lost my dad to covid and I‚Äôm starting to have questions about what my family‚Äôs future looks like. Through the chaos we‚Äôve realized that my mom would need to start working and this is obviously very concerning considering we don‚Äôt want to risk her getting sick again, she has not worked in around 20 years (she worked at as an assistance years ago when she first got here) and isn‚Äôt very strong at English. I know the English might not be such a barrier since we‚Äôre in Miami but I know it‚Äôs important. 
I was wondering if anyone in the community knows of any places of employment or things like that where my mom can apply and make enough to at least sustain herself and my youngest sibling. So with that being said does anyone know of any jobs (like administrative positions or daycares or things that can help her make at least $35,000 a year) that are open to Spanish speaking single moms who have little prior work experience in Miami? I know this is a lot to ask but I just want to make sure there are options for her. Thank you all so much.",Question,1596178126.0

I didn't do it because it's not worth my time and I'm pretty sure no such resource number besides 911 exists.

My brother started getting Covid symptoms three weeks ago. As soon as he did I self quarantined and started working remotely. Although I got mild symptoms (cough and stuffy nose) my doctor recommended that I get tested. My test came back positive and I‚Äôve been in isolation. Based on the new CDC guidelines my doctor cleared me to go back to work after the blood test results came back. My employer won‚Äôt let me go back to work unless I take another nose swab test and it comes back negative. Where in Miami can I get test with fast test results? I need to go back to work ASAP.

The landlord is including electricity on the room rental and stating there is a $120 allowance for electricity included per month; anything above that in the FPL bill is my responsibility.

$120 electric seems very low for that size of a house and I am going to reach out to the landlord today to discuss - if anyone has any feedback or thoughts about going about it let me know.

**The designer warmly welcomed visitors and found inspiration in the property**

Versace  designated specific rooms for visiting family members, with space  intended for his brother Santo, sister Donatella and niece  Allegra. He  also welcomed friends like Cher, who preferred the Wedgwood Suite, and  Elton John, who liked the Safari Suite. Madonna's favorite room had a  bathtub but no shower. Several of Versace's famous acquaintances  followed his example and ended up purchasing their own  [Miami homes](https://skystori.com/versace-mansion-inside-and-outside/5/).

**The mansion showcased Versace's glamorous aesthetic**

Versace  purchased the home, which was built in 1930, in 1992 after spotting it  while on vacation with his family, and it wasn‚Äôt long before he put tens  of millions of dollars into renovating the space, included turning its  24 apartments into 10 over-the-top suites, some of which belonged to the  family-like Donatella, and others which hosted the likes of  Madonna  and Princess Diana. Over the years, it passed through a series of hands  before ultimately selling for $41.5 million in 2013‚Äîand soon reopening  as the [Villa Casa Casuarina](https://skystori.com/versace-mansion-inside-and-outside/3/),   a hotel complete with amenities like spa services and a pool made of  over a million tiles, thousands of which are 24-karat gold.

4247,1594469492," Miami local and internet personality marktheshark is using his charter boat business to unnecessarily ""cull"" sharks and spread anti-shark fear mongering. The self-proclaimed ""shark hunter"" and ""#1 fishing adventure in Miami"" has 170k followers on instagram where he uses slogans like ""tourist lives matter"" and ""keeping the beach safe"" in his captions under photos of dead sharks. This is harmful for us and for our oceans for various reasons.¬†

1. Sharks are vital apex predators. Without their presence, fish populations would exhaust their food supplies and overwhelm the local ecosystem. There is evidence suggesting that the absence of sharks has a negative effect on coral reefs. Coral reefs are under tremendous pressure from warming oceans as it is. Additionally, our vibrant coastal fish communities and coral reefs draw in tourists, and we must preserve them for future generations.¬†¬†
2. He often posts pictures of dead hammerhead sharks. According to the International Shark Attack File, humans have been subject to 17 documented, unprovoked attacks by hammerhead sharks since 1580 AD. No human fatalities have been recorded. There is no need to cull these crucial predators when they are extremely unlikely to hurt any swimmers. On the contrary, their presence attracts diving enthusiasts.¬†
3. He is using fear mongering to justify his actions. Sharks are not as dangerous as Hollywood would have you believe. While movies like ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù are fun to watch, they have ignited anti-shark sentiment and fears that lead to the destruction of these critical predators. The number of yearly shark attacks simply does not back up the notion that these integral animals are a meaningful threat. Waters are not ""shark infested,"" that is simply where sharks live.¬†
4. Not only that, but he is spreading misinformation and hate towards sharks. He even has fan pages on Instagram dedicated to glorifying his practices. These fans call sharks ‚Äúnumskulls‚Äù and complain of ‚Äútoo many sharks.‚Äù There is no reason for this witch-hunt but his business glorifies it.¬†¬†
5. He is profiting off of their destruction. Although he claims to donate the shark meat to feed to homeless, he is nonetheless charging people for ‚ÄúInstagram‚Äôs #1 most exciting charter boat.‚Äù He takes tourists on these witch-hunts and takes photos as trophies. To add insult to injury, he frequently photographs dead sharks next to bikini-clad women, further glorifying his killing.¬†¬†

While many efforts have been made to appeal to his sense of decency, he continues his destructive behavior. Reporting him to authorities has not resulted in any meaningful change. We cannot allow one man‚Äôs egotistical monster-hunter fantasy to wreak havoc on our coastal waters and on the minds of our citizens. I am writing this petition to urge my local leaders to put an end to this baseless witch-hunt. I want my children to enjoy the same oceans I love and I want your children and their children to enjoy them too. Thank you for taking the time to read my petition.

Mayor Gimenez

&gt;No, we actually had tamped down the virus here sufficiently. And the way that we opened was with the advice of our medical personnel. And so we had infectious disease control doctors that were a part of a process of, once we started to open, how to open. And so I have said, we have had a mask order in place. We never have taken it off. The problem is that people started thinking that this virus was really no more. We also had a number of demonstrations here, young people, that were gathered together. A lot of them weren't wearing masks and they were together for hours. And **it wasn't a coincidence that, about two weeks after these demonstrations started, we started seeing these spikes.

Found out Friday that one of my girlfriend's coworkers was directly and repeatedly exposed to someone who has now tested positive. That coworker is supposedly getting tested tomorrow.

She worked a shift with this coworker last Sunday and has potentially been exposed.

She advised her job that she will not be coming in again until at least the exposed coworker tests negative, or she does. She does not have health insurance.

I've been scrambling to find resources on available testing and getting told basically nothing from any official sources.

If you call the Florida department of health - the recording specifically says they can't tell you where to get tested or if you need a test or not.

---

I went to the Miami Dade website - 
https://www.miamidade.gov/global/initiatives/coronavirus/testing-locations.page

It says you can sign up online for drive up testing at three locations - you can't. I've been trying the site since Friday and there's no way to actually schedule an appointment. There's no option to actually schedule one. It just tells you to go to the miami dade website that directed me to the scheduling page in the first place.

I called the Miami Dade Department of Health. 305-324-2400: After waiting for over thirty minutes, I had a poor exasperated woman basically read the exact information off of the website page to me... but missing some of the finer details.

She then provided me with an alternate number for scheduling 305-499-8767 - which goes to a recording that tells you to go to the website and then hangs up on you.

* Open daily, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
* No car required. Must wear a face mask.

* No appointment required

&gt; Johnson &amp; Wales University announced Thursday it will close its campuses in North Miami and Denver.

&gt; The nonprofit university is based in Providence, Rhode Island and also has a campus in Charlotte, North Carolina.
&gt; 
&gt; Its North Miami campus, which was opened in 1992, focuses on culinary and hospitality students, one of the top industries in South Florida and one of the hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.
&gt; 
&gt; According to the Business Journal‚Äôs Book of Lists, Johnson &amp; Wales had 1,361 students and 79 faculty at its North Miami campus. It spans 29 acres at 1701 N.E. 127th St.
&gt; 
&gt; The school will not enroll students in North Miami and Denver in fall 2020. Returning students will be able to complete their education through the 2020-2021 academic year. Operations on those campuses will end by summer 2021.
&gt; 
&gt; Students that will not graduate by the summer of 2021 can transfer to another Johnson &amp; Wales campus. If they are unable to transfer, Johnson &amp; Wales will work with local universities to take them.
&gt; 
&gt; Johnson &amp; Wales Chancellor Mim L. Runey said its board decided to consolidate the university‚Äôs physical footprint in order to become a more comprehensive university. The campuses in North Miami and Denver would not be self-sustaining financially, she said.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúThere were many factors that led to this decision,‚Äù Runey said. ‚ÄúNot only will the number of high school graduates continue to fluctuate in the years to come, with a projected 15% decline between 2025 and 2029 (due to the lower birth rates following the 2008 recession), technology is now expanding the ability of colleges and universities to offer education remotely, diminishing the need for on-ground classrooms and facilities.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Runey also noted that students in culinary programs, which rely on hands-on work, may delay entering school in order to avoid Covid-19. The university must evolve from its niche status in hospitality and culinary arts.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúJWU has made an extraordinary difference in North Miami and Denver, contributing to the economy and raising the level of culinary and hospitality in those metropolitan areas,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe will be forever grateful to all of the North Miami and Denver students, faculty, staff and alumni who have and will continue to proudly call themselves Wildcats.‚Äù",Johnson &amp; Wales University to close it's North Miami campus in Summer 2021,1593373341.0

4777,1593280707,"Hello, I am currently a 29 yr. old resident of Raleigh, NC and I am planning on moving to Miami come the end of July. My current roommate is moving and this leaves me without a place to stay. Most of my friends and family have moved and my social circle has dried up and I think its about time for a fresh start. I've been to Miami a handful of times and enjoyed the feel of it, I grew up in southern CA and the atmosphere is very similar.

I was wondering if anyone, that has made the same move, has any advice on moving here.  I Unfortunately don't have a job lined up yet and from the sounds of things economically this might be a problem with all the re-closures.  While I don't exactly have lot I do have an okay amount of money that will hopefully help me get on my feet. As far as I know I need to have a reliable source of income to sign a lease on a apartment, is there any places I can rent that doesn't require this? or should i just stay at a motel until i get a job.

I don't typically like asking for help but any information would certainly help, if anyone knows of places that are hiring by all means point me in that direction so I can apply. I have over 8 Years of retail and some factory and lab assistant experience.

Any other tips or information I will gladly take, I like knowing as much as possible about things before I actually do them and I'll be honest I'm kinda going in this blind but desperate times call for desperate measures.",Moving to Miami,1593295107.0

LA County alone had only 12,000 fewer cases than the entire state of Florida as of Wednesday: [https://www.lamag.com/article/most-coronavirus-los-angeles-county/](https://www.lamag.com/article/most-coronavirus-los-angeles-county/)

&gt;So far, at least 88,262 cases have been confirmed in Los Angeles County, putting it at the top of the list.  
Just   over 10 million people live in the county, however, meaning the   infection rate is around 870.79 cases for every 100,000 residents. Of   the 978,915 Angelenos who have been tested, eight percent have received   positive results.  
For comparison,  the entire state of Florida,  home to an estimated 21.5 million  residents‚Äìand cited by many as an  example of a state that may have  rushed to reopen too quickly‚Äìnow has a  total of 100,000 confirmed cases  statewide.

In Cook  County, Illinois (Chicago), home to about 5 million people, compared to  Florida, which has 21 million people, they have almost 88,000 cases.   same link as above

And NY, well,  they've had the most deaths by far because of the horrible response by  leaders there. Cuomo and deBlasio were telling people to go out and  enjoy life in mid March. And Cuomo mandated nursing homes take in  elderly people who had been infected.

[https://www.propublica.org/article/two-coasts-one-virus-how-new-york-suffered-nearly-10-times-the-number-of-deaths-as-california](https://www.propublica.org/article/two-coasts-one-virus-how-new-york-suffered-nearly-10-times-the-number-of-deaths-as-california)

&gt;More than 4,500 recovering  coronavirus patients were sent to New York‚Äôs already vulnerable nursing  homes under a controversial state directive that was ultimately scrapped  amid criticisms it was possibly accelerating the outbreaks [https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/ap-count-4300-virus-patients-ny-nursing-homes-70825470](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/ap-count-4300-virus-patients-ny-nursing-homes-70825470)

Unless things get truly insane, no state will come close to totals in NY.

What  does this mean? It means the national media is focusing on Florida  because this is a swing state and it's an election year. Meanwhile, this  situation has been handled much worse in deep blue states. But we're  being told we're doing the worst than places where it's demonstrably  much, much worse.

There's also the issue that a lot of people outside Florida (and a lot in) hate this state because of its politics. People hate Florida because it means so much during presidential elections and because we elect bad senators to the Senate. This state gets a lot of hate and what we're seeing is derived from that.","Hot Take: California is Doing Worse than Florida, but the Media Focus is on Florida Because it's an Election Year",1593217119.0

Last year, Miami-Dade County *increased* it's police spending by 10%, up to nearly $760 million. For the 2019-2020 fiscal year, **Miami-Dade County budgeted 45% of all General Funds for police and prisons.** 

**The City of Miami, meanwhile, allocated one-third of its General Funds for police, spending over $277 million on police for 2019-2020.**

It is time to think of money that goes to police as money that *could* go to educational opportunities, community-based mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, affordable housing programs, arts programs, or resilience and sustainability measures.

[Defund12.org](https://Defund12.org) makes it easy to email government officials and demand that egregious police budgets be reallocated towards social services, education, and combating racial injustice. Here are links to the email templates for [Miami-Dade County](https://defund12.org/miamidade) and the [City of Miami](https://defund12.org/miami).

**All you have to do is fill in the subject line and add your name and information.** 

The templates come with the email addresses for the relevant public officials: for Miami-Dade, that's the county commissioners and the mayor; for Miami, that's the city commissioners, the city clerk, the city attorney, and the mayor.

**Feel free to alter the email, or write your own!** 

(Some people express a concern that mass email campaigns can be made less effective because recipients might set up a filter for identical emails - I'm not sure how much this is a real concern, but you can **add your a sentence or two of your own** to avoid the issue.)

4858,1593097786,"So I got in a car accident in March. I towed it to my GF‚Äôs Uncle‚Äôs shop and thats where its stayed for now. Lets call her uncle Fulano. I recently recieved the 7k check to from state farm to repair it. 

They estimated that amount based on the pictures I sent them by email since they are not sending anyone to physically inspect the vehicle due to covid-19.

But now I‚Äôm in a ‚Äúpower‚Äù struggle as you may say. I‚Äôve noticed when it comes to large money, people get thirsty and crazy. Both my brother and mom try to steer me away from using Fulano‚Äôs shop because he‚Äôs lowkey overcharging the repairs since him, my gf and her dad are trying to get money off it.

According to my brother, the repairs should cost $5000. Not $7000. That he can get a better estimate from someone else. I‚Äôm here like, Well why didnt you give me the hook up in the first place? Or why didnt the lawyer you recommended to me for the lawsuit against the lady who crash give me a better hooke up? Why now? We ended that there.

I then called state farm and they had no record of Fulano discussing price options, they made the estimate themselves, not Fulano. BUT, I call Fulano and he tells me that the estimate thats giving to me is the exact amount needed to fix it and that ‚Äúthe inspector‚Äù suggested a place for him to find two passenger doors that will cost $600.

I have a 2019 toyota corolla and I looked up the cost for the doors. Most range from $300-540. Something felt fishy.

Then this morning, my brother then says he talked to my lawyer and knows someone that can fix it for $4000. That all we gotta do is cash the check, pay Fulano for the amount of time my car was at his shop and pay his other hook up. 

But HERE is the funny part. When he got me the lawyer, I didnt have to pay upfront. He took my case as a favor to my brother. Normally he would need to get paid $1,500 to get started. He said he will get the payment from winning the lawsuit we‚Äôre doing. He did get started on my case in March but just stopped responding to me last week.

My brother then says we can use the 7k to pay the $1,500 to the lawyer and WATCH THIS, pay HIM $1,000 for helping me out. Thats where I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúOoooh okay, I see how it is‚Äù. My own brother straight up hustled me. After both him and the lawyer said I wont have to pay anything to them till after we win the lawsuit. Over my insurance‚Äôs repair money for MY car that I paid for. Mind you, everyone in the household is under state farm EXCEPT him. That check was made from state farm pay to order to me, my dad, mom and fulano.

So I need at least one or two more opinions from reliable mechanics here in miami. I need a close to accurate estimate. I have a bunch of pictures of the outer car damage. I don‚Äôt have internal damage obviously. Most I got is the lane departure sensor giving an error message on the dashboard. It was a pretty nasty crash so it may cost a little more than 7k if the internal is worse.

Anyone got any leads?","Anyone know a good, trustworthy mechanic here in Miami that can give me a car repair estimate based on looking at some pictures?",1593112186.0

The areas we are considering are south beach and doral (spouse will be working out that way). We've been directed to the gables/grove but feel that if we're not going to be on the beach we'd probably rather go to a place like doral where the money goes further. North beach is another option, but it adds quite a bit to both of our commutes. We're still considering all options though. We were pretty much homebodies even before covid and are prioritizing somewhere quiet where we can walk the dog. 

We had planned for a budget of $5k, but it seems that south beach is commanding even higher rents than that. There are a few near that price on the venetian islands, but we'd have to expand our budget a little.

4953,1592848195,"The City of Miami is just one of 34 local governments within Miami-Dade County. The County government has its own budget for police, and each municipal government also budgets for police (many have their own police departments, others have contracts with the county). The total spent on policing within the County is over $1.5 billion. 

[**Funds Budgeted for Policing in All Municipalities of Miami-Dade County**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pz74nD1r7J64l0UrYobMykLJ8pjJNCGP2Gf3GtMNZKI/edit?usp=sharing) \- This spreadsheet includes information on police spending for 31\* of the 34 municipalities in Miami-Dade County, along with links to local budgets.

To give you an idea, here's a sample of a few municipalities in the County and the portion of their General Funds that are spent on policing:

* **El Portal - 39%**
* **Cutler Bay - 46%**
* **Homestead - 55%**
* **Miami Beach - 33%**
* **Miami Gardens - 49%**
* **North Miami - 39%**
* **Surfside - 45%**

On average, municipalities in Miami-Dade County spend **over 40% of General Funds on police**. See the spreadsheet for data on police spending throughout the County. 

**A budget is a moral document - it reflects values and priorities.** Unfortunately, budget documents are often hundreds of pages long and can be difficult to understand if you don't know what you are looking for. The idea for this project is to make key information in local budgets more accessible. This is the time of year that many municipalities make decisions about next year's budget - so if there are some changes you'd like to see, now is the time to speak up!

This project is a work in progress. If you would like to collaborate or have any questions, feel free to comment on the spreadsheet or send me a message here.

My tags expired in April and everything was closed . (Even if I did them online I'm April, I wasn't sure I was going to receive them since everything was closed)  but this morning I got one of the stuck up guards who doesn't understand it's a damn pandemic going on and some rules can be bent to accommodate for things we never thought would happen.

Every other guard knows my car and they let me in because they've spoken to the property manager and he gave them the okay. 

I roll up at 8:30 am and boom denied entrance. I try to show him emails and phone logs between management and myself talking about my registration situation. He basically tells me that management never told him anything directly and can't let me in. I ask him where am I suppose to park with an expired tag and he said outside.

Boom, so I park outside - even pay the meter. I get a big ol' $51 dollar ticket for not having a valid registration. 


So my question is , is this ticket worth fighting for since I had already requested and paid for my registration on June 3rd? , Should I ask management to pay? ,  should I just pay it and continue with my life. 


To make things clear , I have been in contact with management since the first day they flagged me for an expired registration on June 3rd. Everyday I have been getting in the building.

5134,1592280307,"Since I moved to Miami from NYC a few years ago, one of the first things that struck me was that oranges were much more expensive here than in NYC, which I thought was crazy, considering Florida is known for oranges. 

Oranges at grocery stores near my apartment in NYC were regularly 2 for $1. Not the best oranges, but good and not cluttered with seeds.

But in Miami? Seed-filled oranges (juice oranges?) are usually $3 a pound and not as good as the NYC oranges. I don't know if the prices are different elsewhere in the state. 

I did a little research on this and learned that the Florida orange industry has been decimated over the past few years, in large part due to [huanglongbing](https://crec.ifas.ufl.edu/extension/pest/PDF/2017/Huanglongbing.pdf), a Chinese-born bacterium that harms citrus trees (wtf, China?).

5181,1592158723,"Last week Sunday there was a protest/march in Wynwood. It was from 5pm to roughly 9pm. Across social media platforms there were a few shares 1-2 days before. There were a few 'leaders' who spoke briefly of losses to police brutality and the overall direction of the march while advising to be non combative. 95% were masked and there were all ages and ethnicities in the crowd. The majority of the protest was a few chants and road blocking. A few statements in chants like 'no justice no peace fuck the racist police' or 'fuck trump' but no particular policies or proposals beyond a few signs calling Campaign Zero or for the Defunding of the police. Ambulances and a specific car that identified as carrying food and water were let through. Nearly ever car impacted with a few minutes of delay either reversed away or stopped and got out in solidarity until the crowd passed through. Eventually the crowd got to a part of the highway where cops immediately gathered at to prevent the group from getting onto the highway. At this point the protest split. 75% went along another wynwood road, 25% continued to try to get on the highway in front of 12 or so cop cars, easily outnumbering the few protesters getting on the highway. The few were mostly white, and marched with cops along the highway. The protesters did beat up a fellow protester rather quickly for knocking some young girl's tooth out before police got involved. It was a mostly peaceful affair all documented above.  

&amp;#x200B;

One can only wonder how effective these marches are at pushing for change. History shows that they succeeded, but surely they were more disruptive, or larger, or more frequent? I'm not sure. We definitely and desperately need changes in our country with the 40 million plus job losses and the moratoriums ending on Rent and Mortgages that will cause a larger housing crisis and leave millions homeless on the horizon.

In the wake of George Floyd's killing by Minneapolis police last month, local government and law-enforcement agencies across the nation have been forced to hold a mirror to themselves and examine the policies, actions, and words that have contributed to violence and oppression of black people.

Amid the backdrop of protests and rallying cries against racist policing, the head of the City of Miami's black police union, the Miami Community Police Benevolent Association (MCPBA), has unearthed an instance when Chief Jorge Colina allegedly used the N-word during a law-enforcement training session¬†about drug operations in 1997. 

""This is a secret in the closet that Colina doesn't want to come out,"" says Sgt. Stanley Jean-Poix, president of the MCPBA.

Jean-Poix says that for years, the MCPBA has received countless complaints from retired officers and longtime members of the police department about the alleged incident. The slur became a part of the department's folklore over the years, he says, but no one could substantiate the claims and many believed Colina was never reprimanded.

Jean-Poix says he spent months requesting public records and interviewing at least ten union members who held various positions within the police department and were familiar with the incident. At least four of those sources confirmed to Jean-Poix that while Colina was an officer in the Special Investigations Section, he referred to Overtown ‚Äî one of Miami's segregated, historically black neighborhoods ‚Äî as ""Niggertown"" during a presentation about his experiences in street narcotics. The class involved officers from police departments across Miami-Dade and Monroe counties.

""He didn't say it at the dinner table,"" Jean-Poix says. ""He didn't say it at the water cooler. He said it in a class with experienced officers.""

*New Times* reached Colina via text message yesterday afternoon and requested a phone interview to discuss the allegation. Colina responded with a text message: ""Outrageous. My record speaks for itself. Unbelievable that my detractors would use this critical moment in our nation for their own selfish, self serving agenda. Disgusting.""

He did not respond to a follow-up call and text. 

When *New Times* reached out again this morning, Colina responded that he was in a city commission meeting but denied Jean-Poix‚Äôs claims: ""But yes I do dispute that I used a racial slur. And you're being used.""

He did not respond to a text asking if he would make himself available for an interview.

The MCPBA [announced in a press release](https://twitter.com/mcpba1946/status/1271177889069912065) this afternoon that it plans to hold a press conference tomorrow at 4 p.m. to discuss its findings and call for Colina's termination.

When Colina was sworn in as chief in January 2018, the N-word story resurfaced. Last year, while the MCPBA was representing black officers who filed complaints against racist statements and behaviors by white officers, Colina's use of an epithet came up again.

""We said, let's do an actual investigation into this,"" Jean-Poix says. 

One of the union president's sources told him Colina had in fact received a formal reprimand. The union president says he reviewed the chief's personnel file and internal affairs records and found nothing. He thought that was the end of it. Then he remembered that the city maintains records of all its employees in a government building along the Miami River.

Jean-Poix made an appointment to review Colina's file in mid-March and¬†discovered a vaguely worded reprimand that lined up with the complaints the union had been hearing.

The reprimand, dated May 6, 1997, reads in part:   


&gt;On Tuesday, April 15, 1997, Officer Jorge Colina was instructing a class of experienced officers on Street Narcotics Operations. As a teaching technique, Officer Jorge Colina related an experience into his street narcotics presentation that was offensive to some members of the class. Although Officer Colina apologized to the class the utterance of the scenario was inappropriate.  


The reprimand concludes that Colina violated departmental policies on tact and consideration.

The union's discovery comes seven months after the organization, which represents about 300 members, issued¬†a [vote of no confidence ](https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miamis-black-police-union-says-mpd-chief-jorge-colina-should-be-fired-11316826)in the chief and called for his firing.¬†Jean-Poix said¬†at the time¬†that in the two years Colina had served as chief, he had done little to address the disparate treatment of black officers in the department. Jean-Poix said ‚Äî and still believes ‚Äî that¬†the department's leadership has a pattern of allowing racist officers to stay on the force and silencing black officers who speak out against unfair treatment with loosely justified demotions and transfers. 

In a presentation to the city commission in January,¬†MCPBA leaders¬†outlined several cases that illustrate that pattern, including instances in which a supervisor used a racist slur against a black subordinate, a supervisor mocked a Haitian detective for his accent and proficiency with the English language, and a detective who found an image on his desk that showed a decapitated black man. In each case, the union said the incidents weren't addressed and that the officers who filed the complaints were demoted or transferred to other departments.

Lt. Ramon Carr, vice president of MCPBA, says some of the organization's members have taken issue with TV news appearances during which Colina has praised the department for its community policing, training, diversity statistics, and handling of recent protests when the leadership hasn't addressed racism inside the department.

""These guys know racism is pervasive in the police department,"" Carr says. ""They just felt it was a slap in their face.""

Carr, Jean-Poix, and the union's sergeant-at-arms, Sgt. Travis Lindsey, have led the effort to bring Colina's alleged use of the slur to light. They say they expect some form of retaliation.

""There aren't enough law-enforcement officers speaking up or pushing back against their peers when their peers are doing something wrong,"" Carr says. ""What do you do? Do you allow it to happen?""

The MCPBA leaders say talking about the 1997 incident is important because they believe that if Colina used a slur to describe an entire community, he might harbor implicit biases that affect his ability to address racism in the department and to work to root it out.

Jean-Poix says union leaders want to set an example for others, especially younger officers, by taking a stand against something they believe is wrong in the Miami Police Department's history.

""Call me crazy, but I feel like it's the morally right thing to do,"" Jean-Poix says. ""It's a bad culture, and you have to break it.""",Black Police Union Says Miami Police Chief Used N-Word in the '90s,1592003123.0

5247,1591972965,"Hello. I moved to a new apartment in February in Coral Gables and there seems to be a colony of cats that live on this property and the house next door. I have a small dog and recently, the cats had 6 kittens and have become very defensive. 

They attacked my dog the other night (I have a small dog) and I ended up at the vet as a result, they follow me as I leave the building, and I saw them attack two large dogs today and their owner as they walked in front of the complex. The owner was covered in scratches. I called 311 and they said there is nothing they can do. My landlord mocked me when I brought this up to him and basically said ‚Äúnot our problem. The neighbors feed them.‚Äù Well, the cats live on your property and I told him he is liable. They offered to let me out of the lease so I am looking for another place to live but regardless, this will happen again to another tenant or people walking by. 

There are now a total of 6 kittens and 4 adult cats living outside of the building. They‚Äôve also brought fleas into the building and the landlord treated the building at least. 

The landlord also told me I can catch them if I want and bring them to humane society where they will neuter and release them back. Not sure if that‚Äôs my responsibility.

They had a GIANT banner (bigger than any other signage at the march) that was modeled after the Ten Commandments tablets. At the top it read ""SINNERS"" and then the two columns listed who they thought were SINNERS. I couldn't get a good look at the whole list but at the very top was ""HOMOSEXUALS,"" I know I saw ""SOCIALISTS,"" and I wanna say there was something like ""LOOSE WOMEN"" or even ""SLUTS."" But the one that really stuck with me (because it was so silly) was (this was seriously on their list of sinners) ""PARTY ANIMALS."" 

Their arrival was sudden and disruptive, both generally and during a moment of silence. 

I didn't get a look at their whole list of SINNERS because within about 4 minutes of their arrival, there was some kind of altercation / tug-of-war over the sign and I didn't see them for the rest of the event. 

I'm curious if anyone on here knows if these guys were part of a named-organization (Proud Boys, etc) or just independently-acting campus conservatives. Also wondering if anybody saw what happened that made them leave? No interest in doing anything with the information, it was just such a weird moment. I'm curious WTF happened. 

Among the weirdest parts is how few of them there seemed to be? I'd never show up to counter-protest a Klan rally with only one other person....kinda reveals a naive sense of protection and entitlement.","""Christian"" hate group at Saturday's Black Lives Matter march along Biscayne",1591726329.0

That Alice Bravo oversaw the decision to provide limited supplies for drivers has been verified. The Transportation Workers Union has been actively protesting the department since this all started and have filed a lawsuit against director Alice Bravo in Miami-Dade circuit court as reported by the Miami Herald.

Here is what [Transportation Workers Union 291 President Jeff Mitchell](https://twu291.org/site/) had to say about the current state of affairs.

Interview by u/sharkline

**FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW, WHO IS ALICE BRAVO?**

Alice Bravo is the director of Public Works and Transportation. Mayor Carlos Gimenez merged Public Works with Transportation. Why do that? We never see each other.

So he brought Alice Bravo in. She was not a transit director from a big agency. And a lot of times, that shows. And in this case, it's been showing. She's trying to juggle Public Works and Transit, and those are two big jobs that I don't think one person should manage.

She was trying to use Transit dollars for Public Works, and the County got their hand slapped for that.

You can see mistakes being made based on inexperience in the agency. When you work with people who have 20, 30, and 40 years of experience and you don't take their advice, that doesn't make you that bright.

You got people working for you that were directors in New York, Boston, DC, and you're listening to a finance guy, Alberto Parjus, and I just don't get it.

This is a comedy of errors.

Parjus had a brilliant idea to get bleach and chlorine from Water &amp; Sewer, and I explained to him that it wasn't bleach in a bottle. I used to be a water treatment op, and what they have is chlorine gas that will make 3,000 gallons of bleach.

You don't want a bus operator trying to make that. No way. So that plan went down in flames, but he already had it in action and had already ordered some of that particular type of chlorine.

Those are the type of decisions being made.

This is the same guy who recommended that people download about a thousand pages of training material online for things like repairing radar systems when people are working on repairing tracks, and giving them two weeks before the test on it, and trying to set them up to fail.

For years we had a labor protection called 13c that they have to give first opportunity to members of my bargaining unit, and it insures you get local people from the area working in these positions. It worked for forty years, and they've been trying to get around it and not hire our people. They're trying to bring in their cronies to do the work.

This is not a job, this is a career that puts people and their kids through school. You can start at the lowest level and work your way up.

Our Assistant Director of TWU 291 started as an operator.

We are dealing with people who make $265,000 a year, but the minute you try to better yourself in your own career, that's a bad thing.

They get the money to make bad decisions and we're trying to make a living to keep our system running and keep our families together.

Where's the little guy?

The mayor was trying to get out of taking federal dollars so he wouldn't have to adhere to federal labor laws.

And this has been the environment for the past eight years. But we will elect someone new, and several commission seats will open.

The people are entrenched and what they do is the administration buys them out and gets them special projects, and so all that person needs is seven votes, and they start ushering through all the crazy stuff being passed.

Recently, the administration got caught by an inspector general report investigating their trip to China where it was found the mayor cut a side deal for a monorail with the Genting Group, a Malaysian casino developer that houses its own workers and pays them a dollar an hour and has total impunity to design, build, and operate the system and no locals would get these jobs.

The county mayor, Carlos Gimenez, was caught in that meeting using burner phones and erasing their data. And when this came out, they had a come-to-Jesus moment about our transit workers getting their PPE supplies.

We filed a lawsuit and forced them into providing masks, sanitizers, gloves...Originally, it was one sanitary wipe for all day long to wipe down areas. They got caught flatfooted and now they're jumping through hoops. Everything we have on our list, they're trying to do it. They're going to retrofit buses and completely seal off the drivers. We have them installing see through curtains behind the operator to shield them from exposure.

Now they've installed hand sanitizer on the bus, and we want extra masks on hand for the passengers. A lot of them are on the lower end of society and don't have money like that.

It's not the operator's job to argue with passengers. They are trained to transport people whether they have a mask or not.

So right now there is an effort to correct the wrongs they did and now we just have to stay on top of them.

A week and a half ago in the maintenance areas, they were not getting masks. And look how deep we are into this pandemic.

We had people go out with the virus. One of my members survived being on the respirator. So the urgency is there now that they know this is not a short term thing.

At least 20 people here (transportation workers) contracted the virus. Transit workers, technicians that work on the ticket machines contracted the virus... A lot of times people may not know they have it and are already spreading it. And that's the evilness of Covid-19.

I just fear that this administration has dropped the ball.

So all of this leads up to the way they think about employees. You have all these gimmicks, and now a lot of the dirt is coming out.

Gimenez wants to run for congress against Mucarsel-Powell and I don't want him to be in that position. He's anti-labor. People deserve to get paid what they're worth for their skilled labor.

Now it looks like a mad dash to finish all of these deals that were made before he's turned out.

We had to file a discrimination suit against the agency because of these disparities.

My bargaining unit is about 85% African American and the balance is Latino. And to have to be subjected to the Corona Virus without protection is similar to the Tuskegee Experiments, and we're not going to be party to that, and we filed that case and that's coming up as well.

There has been a real bias against our bargaining unit. We deserve the same protections as everyone else.

Police and Fire told me that if we needed some PPE, they were willing to donate stuff they had in inventory. But see, in my bargaining unit I have maintenance control that account for supplies, and they told me that when the County was only providing one cleaning wipe for an eight hour shift, they had one hundred thousand pieces of PPE and ten thousand pieces stored in a transit warehouse that they were just holding and not issuing to employees. So that's why we filed discrimination with the EEOC.","Miami Transportation Workers See Death On Every Corner, But Is A Racist County Government Waiting At The Bus Stop?",1591296425.0

We are doing this in solidarity with a growing list of subreddits, including r/NBA, r/AskReddit, r/AskHistorians, and r/MaleFashionAdvice among many others.

We love all of you, and love reading all of your comments -- even the shitposts -- but the current situation has created an environment where silence is no longer an option. Reddit has [condemned racists and hate groups publicly](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/01/remember-the-human-black-lives-matter/), but has taken limited action when their hand is forced by user advocacy and activism. This isn't good enough. We aren't a huge subreddit, but we hope that adding our voice to the voices of others will go a long way towards holding Reddit accountable to back their words up with actions.

Reddit continues to offer safe refuge to some of the most abhorrent behavior on the internet. They are well known for it, in fact. In the midst of historic protests to ensure that all Americans are able to exercise their rights - their most fundamental rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness - Reddit's admins continue to hide behind thin veils of impartiality, leaving moderators to do the hard work of ensuring that subreddits remain welcoming to all, regardless of race, sex, gender, national origin, language, and sexual preferences.

This is not a liberal or conservative cause. This is a human cause. Hate, discrimination, racism, sexism, homophobia, and calls for violence cannot be tolerated from either side of the political spectrum, by either side of the political spectrum. The mods of r/Miami stand in unwavering support of the protesters who are risking their lives to make America a more just and a more equitable place. We stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter. We stand in solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community (happy Pride Month!). We stand in solidarity with all people of color, and all those being oppressed and marginalized. Stand with us, r/Miami, and let's show the world what kind of community we really are.

And in the meantime, please consider donating to one of the charities working hard to provide justice and relief to the protesters.

The Miami Municipal Code regarding construction noise states (between 8am and 6pm) ‚Äúthat the sound level at or across a real property boundary exceeds a reading of 0.79 weighted average dBA for the daily period of operation.‚Äù 

It also states an exception.... ‚ÄúThe city manager is hereby authorized to permit the operation and use of any of the above construction machinery during the aforesaid prohibited periods of time in the event that such operation or use is required to eliminate or reduce any dangerous or hazardous condition which endangers life or property.‚Äù 

So basically, he can just okay such noise EVERY DAY FOR YEARS if it is fixing some sort of problem??? And we all just must live with it???? What about people working from home during this time? None of us even have places to go during the day???

Please help! I‚Äôm going insane with someone drilling into my walls all day!!!",Residential Noise Help!!!,1591212157.0

I really hope to think that what people are saying is true, and it's just a minority of opportunistic chaotic people doing these actions because it is sad to see small businesses and our city being looted and burned- even black and minority owned businesses.

The true message and cause of these protests is being drowned out because of this. Now, the thing that comes to the front of people's mind will be the looters and violent individuals, not George Floyd or the message for justice.

I am also seeing cops and Latinos/whites being shamed on Twitter for doing the right things saying that they're doing it just for show or to buy popularity. It is ignorant to generalize an entire profession, race, or anything at all. We must unite at all fronts at this point if we want any of this to end.

In my opinion, the media and the mainstream want you to loot and cause violence. It's actually giving the oppressors the victory because now they have to something to smear the movement's name with and make people forget its true purpose and justify more oppression/violence.

FU to the cops involved in this incident.

FU to the people who stood by, watched this incident, and did nothing.

If attempting to save someone's life will result in your incarceration or something worse, then so be it.

FU to those participating in riots ... looting ... burning down buildings ... etc.

Being frustrated with social injustice is no excuse for acts of evil; especially when those crimes are committed against people who have nothing to do with the matter.

FU to the politicians and lawmakers who are trying to turn this incident into a political matter.

Trying to sway the vote I see.

How about you try to sway yourself away from the influence of the devil?

To those of you who want to make this a black vs. white issue, I say stop being lazy with directing your anger.

Generalizing and stereotyping a certain demographic of people is just weak.

In case you didn't notice, each one of us is just one of one.

It's funny how things like this happen and people totally ignore or forget what members of their ""own community"" have done in the past.

This applies to all ""communities""; not just certain ones.

Here's a bit of a history and business lesson for you.

In order to have a buyer, you need a seller.

Well, to those of you hanging your hat on the idea that the ""white man"" is the devil ideology, I say that devil had to buy that slave from someone.

And you know who that someone is?

In the case of ""blacks"", they were sold off by their ""own people"".

As someone who you would identify as being of Indian descent, I'm well aware of the history of the people of India selling off their ""own"" to the ""white man"".

Obviously, no one should be participating in human trafficking on either end of the transaction.

That being said, look at your ""own people"" before bitching about someone else.

Hell, human trafficking still exists today.

In many countries across the globe, children are kidnapped (usually by what you consider to be their ""own kind"") and sold off.

But you don't want to address that, right?

Many people (including myself), regardless of what religion they practice, believe in Adam and Eve.

It's funny how you can believe that we all come from the same two people but then live your life as if you don't.

Wake up.

That race shit is played out.

So is ethnicity.

So is nationality.

And so is all of this other man made bullshit.

All it does is segregate people and prevent progress and advancement.

Here's to just being fucking human and looking at each and every one of us as individuals.

Maybe the world would a little better if we did that.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Llevat ‚Äì 

During these times of heightened tension I would like answers to the following:

‚Ä¢	What specific training occurs at Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPD) to make sure murders like George Floyd do not occur

‚Ä¢	How de-escalation is being emphasized, if at all, during training

‚Ä¢	How are officers with multiple complaints on their records, and/or lawsuits, are handled and is there a maximum number of complaints before they are fired

‚Ä¢	Is there a policy in place to make sure that fired police officers or those with multiple strikes are not moved around within the County/cities and conversely, to make sure we don‚Äôt hire police officers with said records from other places

‚Ä¢	Is there continual, mandatory mental evaluation by a third party for officers

‚Ä¢	If a civilian oversight board has been discussed by the Mayor or the Department (similar to City of Miami oversight)

I tried to find the answers online (official website and social media)  but could not find anything.

When we received stay at home orders, my friend David and I started looking for meat and produce for our families so we could eat healthier meals since it was already looking like we'd be in it for the long haul. However, grocery store delivery had limited supply and a lot of meat/produce subscription box services had just started waitlisting, so we started to do farm research and found some really great farms that delivered locally to our doors as well as farms that deliver nationwide during this pandemic.

We started to put together a database of farms that have online stores where you can get meat, produce, and dairy delivered straight to your doors or available for pick-up at the farm. We just finished adding new farms this week that are located in Florida so we thought that r/Miami would love to have this resource. It is a great way to help our local farmers and help people who are looking for farm foods.

So far we have around \~700 farms right now in our database. This is a work in progress. We are still in the beginning stages and we‚Äôre doing all the research manually, so let us know if you have any suggestions, whether it‚Äôs farms to add or ideas!

This was in reference to someone who had written ""White People Belong in Europe"" on the kobe mural in Wynwood, white people complaining as they're known to do when they don't get their way and the ""special treatment"" they believe they're so entitled to even in our city because to them all brown and black people only exist to serve them, and one of the posters even taking their blatant racism a step further and claiming that all races believe ""white women to be the most attractive"", which is ungrounded stupidity at best and white supremacy at worst. 


So here goes. 



The funny thing is white people believe and are under the pretentious presumption that they should be allowed to send any immigrants who don't look like them or don't come from the same ethnic background as them to whatever country they feel like they should go back to. Yet, they don't like it when the same rules are applied to them. Typical white privilege. The whites will do what they best, by applying the double standards as usual. 

This is Miami. Latinos transformed the city and made it the buzzing and beautiful empire it is today. Latinos run Miami, and as such, they're allowed to express themselves without fear of ""the white man no likey"". If you don't like it, GTFO of the city. No one invited you to the latin party. Latinos developed the city, built it, and transformed it - and although white people would like to believe that they get to set the rules in the rest of the country although they built this country on the backs of others they so conveniently neglected to acknowledge and credit for their work, Miami is one place they sure as hell don't run the show because Latinos there are smarter than to let that fly. But keep throwing your temper tantrums as the bigoted and lost children you are and always have been, just because you don't get your way and receive the ""silver spoon"" treatment that you've gotten used to everywhere else that you've taken advantage of and controlled others. Fuck. This is just as bad as those stupid gringos who believe that they're entitled to people only speaking in English to them and firmly want to fight against not learning Spanish in Miami although 70% or more of the population in Miami is Hispanic because ""they're in the USA, and they shouldn't have to"", not noticing where in the USA they are. Wah waaaah. Keep crying - or do something worthwhile for once with all that energy and at least learn Portuguese. It'll do you better than not knowing either Spanish or Portuguese and trying to claim Miami as yours and acting like ""white women are the superior race"" like another poster in this thread tried to imply, although everyone in MIA has made it very clear they're not. It's easy to see why people in the city don't like you. Suit yourselves. Waaaah. But, I digress. 

Al blanco no le gusta... Entonces que carajo hace ah√≠? Like Bad Bunny says, ""Arranca pal carajo!"" cause Latinos created this city and nobody invited you here. You have dozens of other cities in the USA and you believed you're entitled to ours or to Atlanta (shout-out and nod to my fellow African Americans who deal with the same BS us Latinos do)? Go to Nashville or Birmingham where people will actually care about your ""white is the dominant race"" bullshit tirades, and leave us alone. 

Miami's our city and in our city, you play by our rules. Damn right, self-centered assholes.

6067,1589713042,"Hi everyone! I am a 21F looking to move to Miami (probably by myself) when I graduate college. I graduate in December but I‚Äôm sticking around Atlanta where I currently live for spring semester to work and save money. My tentative plan is to move next June, by which I will be 22.

I‚Äôve considered grad school but for right now my main priority is to make enough money to support myself and have some spending money to have fun with. Whether that‚Äôs working in the restaurant industry or nannying or something temporary like that is fine with me, I don‚Äôt have a burning desire to start my career just yet.

I want to enjoy being young and I want to PARTY. Miami appeals to me because of the party lifestyle and the beach, I grew up on coastal Georgia so I know all about the weird weather and humidity and lack of seasons. Like I said, I went to college in Atlanta so I‚Äôm used to traffic and will be bringing a car but I want to use it as little as possible. 

Any and all advice/comments/words of wisdom would be appreciated! Where to live, how to find a roommate if I do end up going alone, the best places to party and drink, recommendations for anything would be great. Thanks!","Young, restless, ready to party",1589727442.0
6068,1589693637,"While I believe we **desperately** need to alleviate traffic in Kendall I had an idea about an extension that is basically the north corridor but extended to then terminate in downtown Ft.Lauderdale. I believe it'd be beneficial because it would:

&amp;#x200B;

* Provide an affordable one seat ride between both cities
* Bus routes could converge on the line easily increasing mobility for those in the suburbs
* Create connections with both Ft.Lauderdale Tri-Rail and Brightline stations making them both integral transpiration hubs
* Is more feasible than the other routes since it runs along 27th/University and then straight onto Broward Blvd.
* Makes commuting for a lot of people in Broward seem like a much more viable option

&amp;#x200B;

This, combined with possibly increasing headways for tri-rail I believe could make transportation in South Florida a lot easier given our current situation. While it IS very long (25 miles) it could be a critical corridor to invest in for the years to come. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are your guys' thoughts? Do you think we should still focus more south?

I am currently studying computer science in France and will have my engineer degree in 1.5 years. I Really wanted to live in the US, I've been there 4 times in 2 years. 1 times in Miami. I red a lot of things about the city and I really liked the spirit. My ""goal"" is to live downtown (I like skyscrappers).

But I have few questions and seeking for advices :

* Is the city expensive ? I saw that the average income for a software engineer in the US is  around $100k/y, is it enough to live (alone) downtown ?
* Is it common to live in a skyscrapers (I think it's called a condo ?) ? 
* Are there any ""hidden cost"" for living there (I already know a little bit about the taxes system and insurances) ?
* Is anybody working in the computer science / software developper field and can let me know how is the employment market ?
* Talking about visas, I'm not sure but I think some companies can provide visas right ? 

Of course before coming there, I will spend 6 months to make sure it's the life I wanted.

First, buying a place.  Obviously, if possible, we'd love to get him a place as cheaply as possible.  The ideal situation would be to snap up a decently nice 2br/2bth from a distressed Airbnb sell at a good price.  Anyone have any insight into when we might see the best deals?  My pops has a very active lifestyle, so the absolute best area for him would be somewhere between Flamingo Park and Lummus Park, so he can walk/ride his bike everywhere, shop/eat/exercise locally, etc.

Second, I'm going purchase this place and put it in my name, while my pops will pay the monthly bills/property tax. I've never owned any property before.  Is this a scenario that prevents me from using the HFA preferred grant (assuming it still exists after the coming budget cuts)?  I don't want to pull any sort of scam, but getting those closing fees taken care of would be nice.

Third, I've researched crime in the area and have spent a lot of time on South Beach, especially in that area bounded by Lincoln/5th and Flamingo/Lummus Parks, but I'm curious about people's opinions on safety, particularly for a 65-70 year old man.

Finally, community.  I know that most of the older people stuff is happening further or even much further north.  Is there a South Beach community for older people there?  Things my pops could get involved with?  He doesn't speak Spanish, alas.

i should mention I‚Äôve lived in this neighborhood since 2011. 

At the canal on the railing today there are loads of ducks, not the black ones you find at Baptist but light brown ducks with long legs. I look at them for a bit then turn around and I see a 2015 Nissan Rogue (I looked up the tag number) 400 meters down the street. I walk towards them and they ever so slowly inch toward me like a wary animal stopping and starting.   


Then they pause in front of me and turn right into the house driveway. I think I‚Äôm not going to walk into the exhaust cloud you just made so turn around to spend more time with the ducks. Soon two cyclists come and park their bikes at the canal and so I leave.

when I leave I turn to the right and notice that the same car is idling there and just walk forward. Then almost immediately the car pulls off and drives off.

wha? I thought you lived there? You‚Äôre just waiting for me to leave?

6301,1588890724,"Hi everyone,

Some of you on here seem knowledgable on buying, selling, and renting property in Miami-Dade County, so I figured this would be a good place to ask.

I am a 26 year old graduate student whose father recently passed away. One of things my father left me is his paid-off 3 bedroom home in Coral Gables, which is valued somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000.

I do not want to sell the home for nostalgia purposes, as well as the possibility that it might be more profitable to rent instead of selling immediately. I live out of state--if not I'd probably live in it with my fianc√©e.

Does anyone here have experience being in a situation like this in Miami-Dade County (not necessarily inheriting, but renting a home for profit)? The house is not brand new, but it's not completely out of date either. A google search tells me that the rental value is somewhere between $2,200 and $2,800 a month in rent. I am thinking that taking into account property taxes, insurance, and setting aside some money for maintenance, I will need to charge around that. Is that realistic? Thoughts, comments (that are helpful), or things I made need to think about but haven't? Anything will help me in my young, inexperienced (when it comes to owning property) mind.

Also, I don't mean to come off as a privileged fuck. I understand how lucky I am. I'm just collecting information.",Rent or Sell Inherited House in Coral Gables?,1588905124.0

6348,1588729054,"So basically I have lived in the same house my entire life and my mom has lived in it for almost 25 years and plans to keep it for the rest of her life. The issue is that next door we used to have about 3 small houses (it's a really big lot) all owned by the same guy, until about 2 years ago when he decided to knock it all down and build a 4 story apartment building. The construction has been going on for over a year and a half and has caused noise from 7am-7pm everyday of the week except Sunday (some days are better than others), trash/concrete from the construction to go all over our backyard, damage on our fence from the construction, I can't really ever go in my backyard anymore without being looked out by 5 construction men, and sometimes there will also be a bunch of construction trucks/cars in front of my house that block the entire street (to the point where I can't even back out of my garage). My mother refuses to sell the house even though everyone has told her to because being that we live in Miami the real estate is way too expensive and she got this house a long time ago for a good deal and knows that she would not be able to get any type of deal like that anymore, plus she's a teacher so it would be hard to find something nice that she could afford.  

Also whenever people see the building and how out of place it is in the neighborhood they always think that it is illegal, but since they recently changed the zoning of the street that we live anyone can build up to a 5 stories. The man that is in charge of the whole thing is impossible to reach. Due to all of the damage and lack of privacy that he has given us over the last year we have tried to reach out to him a couple of times, but he never responds. Sometimes he will pull up in his Bentley, but neither one of us have ever spoken to him because he is never there for long and when he is the only reason that we know is because of his car. He usually hides, probably because he know that we all hate him, and really the only reason why I know what is car looks like is because he will either park right in front of the construction or on the grass in front of our house, and nobody on our street owns a Bentley (it's a fairly middle class neighborhood, but just in a good location).  

Also the building has 6 big balconies that are directly above out backyard/pool, but nowhere else. I am not sure if this was done on purpose, since we HAD a pretty nice backyard, but there is no balconies anywhere else around the building and now we have ZERO privacy.

Anyways so I have realized that at this point there is not much that we can do about the building. My mom has gotten a lawyer to try to get the people in charge to pay for all of the damage that they have done to our house and also pay for some sort of awning to over our pool for SOME privacy. I am expecting for the building to be done and on the market for rent by around September.

 Basically what I am asking is what are some things that we could do to stop people from wanting to rent(mostly the people with the balconies over our backyard) or at least that could really piss off the owner of this building since he's a complete shit head. My mother was thinking about buying these REALLY bright lights and shining them directly on the balconies and also putting up a big sign that says ""expect construction 2021"". We have also though about putting really loud obnoxious music on the speakers outside, but that would piss off all of the other neighbors.

6431,1588444748,"I had a situation yesterday. Seeking for some help.

Bought myself a bike via offerup in Kendall West. Went literally 150m to grab some sandwich and realised that I have no phone on me. In like 10 minutes of time and 150 meters my week-old iPhone SE were somehow gone. I went same path twice to look for it maybe I dropped it in the grass. Because I just bought it I haven‚Äôt fully used it and turned on everything, downloaded every app I need, etc. So ‚ÄúFind my iPhone‚Äù feature wasn‚Äôt switched on, otherwise it would make things easier. The other problem is that I am from Europe and I have a European sim inside. So I could not call it straight away without having international roaming. For the same reason I don‚Äôt have mobile data switched on so I couldn‚Äôt reach it with WhatsApp call.

Today I asked my friends to call my number wondering if gadget is still on (otherwise it‚Äôs obvious the phone is gone). It is working, but nobody is picking up yet. I asked friends to keep on calling time to time and in case someone pick up to contact me with my US number.

So what do think should I do? I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs working in States if someone finds your stuff and want to give it back to the owner. Should I contact the police in this case? I have the original box on me with all the IMEI and other stuff. Do they actually deal with such cases? I need to leave Miami in 4 days so I am kinda worried if I could gonna get it back by that time, especially if I‚Äôll dive in all the bureaucracy with the officials.

I know phone is just a phone, but I am foreigner here and I would like to have my belongings with me. Besides, the thing is brand new and it‚Äôs a shame how all this could happen.

Thanks for any real advices that you could give me guys in my stupid situation.

I hope you‚Äôre doing well and keeping safe!

I spoke to an FIU representative yesterday from Student Financials, and he let me know that FIU Administration is still debating whether or not to waive the fee. I genuinely think if enough movement is made with this petition, it will sway their choice.

She was always really wary of going outside. She used to walk around the neighborhood, but now she doesn‚Äôt even take her trash out (outside the front door)

 In December, she started saying she heard voices in the walls and people walking on her house.  Over time, she‚Äôs been talking to the walls and saying she feels hot intense pain and shocks all through her body. As of recent, she doesn‚Äôt even talk to me.  She sleeps for only an hour or so a day and barely eats. On the phone, she acknowledges me, but she then she starts talking to people in the wall. 

My grandfather was working, but since has had to stay home to care for her. He‚Äôs frustrated and lacking sleep too, so he doesn‚Äôt have much patience. 

When it began to occur, my grandmother refused to visit the doctor and said nothing was wrong. Since it‚Äôs gotten worse, we had to do a video chat with a psychiatrist and some seroquil was prescribed.

I cant tell you how many messages like this from teachers and staff I get each day. Our local public school is a Title I public school which means most of the families were already living below the poverty line before COVID hit. The school is Morningside K-8 Academy.  


We have families now who are unable to get food, let alone household essentials. Many of the charity organizations are too far for them‚Äîthey don‚Äôt have cars or even enough to cover bus fare. The dade public school systems has been amazing and set up meal pick up stations where families can pick up pre-packed breakfast and lunch for all household members to cover them through the weekend. But it‚Äôs not enough.  


I run the school PTSA and we are working with social workers and teachers to identify the families in the greatest need. We have been purchasing and delivering groceries for these families as well as $175 publix gift cards‚Äîthese gift cards can be used for groceries, pharmacy and household needs. I personally deliver every gift card and food box. Often, as I‚Äôm delivering them, I get approached by neighboring families begging for help.  


We have helped 24 families to date and have raised $4,500. 100% of donations go towards these families.

Hi everyone! Not sure if this is the right spot to post or not, open to suggestions if anyone knows of another place I could post as well though!

But, if anyone is looking for student housing, specifically apartments, I‚Äôm actually looking to cancel my lease due to financial issues, etc. with COVID-19 and am unable to move from Nevada to Florida this year, with The One at University City. 

I have been told that it would be best to find someone who is also interested in the Alhambra Unit I had originally looked at in order for me to cancel the lease.

Please let me know if these apartments are something you are interested in.

They‚Äôre brand new, fully furnished apartments across the street from FIU.

I signed for the Alhambra room. It‚Äôs a single room 1x1, fully furnished, new amenities, W/D, etc. It's currently going for $1320 (they also currently have a special going on if you sign a lease with them now). 

Please let me know if you‚Äôre interested or are looking to sign a lease with them (or if you know someone else who is) for the Alhambra Unit soon and other suggestions help as well.

Here is a link to the website where you will find all the amenities, Alhambra Unit Floor Plan, specials, etc. : https://www.theoneatuc.com/

So that leaves PEUC, $600 weekly Federal which has a piggy bank of $250 Billion. 
Well if the PPP had a piggy bank of $350 Billion and ran out in 2 weeks a once banks started processing applications. 

Only reason PEUC hasn‚Äôt run out of money yet is because States are so slow at processing and paying out claims. Like Florida. There‚Äôs no way $250 Billion is enough for everyone to get $600 even once, let alone for 16 weeks. It will run out of money before 99% of Floridians get anything. Might as well start looking for work now because this money was never meant to be paid out and it was never enough.

6875,1586797955,"Hello all. In the midst of all this craziness, I am considering a move to Miami and couldn't be more excited to learn more. I currently live in Center City Philadelphia, and have my eyes set on Brickell as a neighborhood of choice due to its density and urban feel. With that said, I was hoping you all could help with a few questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Based upon my Zillow and Trulia searches, it seems like a $1,800 per month budget for a 1 bedroom apartment is doable, similar to pricing here in Philly. But I've seen rental options as high as $8,000 per month which makes me worried that these lower priced options are scams. Is $1,800 enough for a 1 bedroom, or are apartments as expensive as places like NYC and SF?
2. I've been reading a lot of info on condo rental websites that First+Last+Security Deposit is typically due at signing, is this pretty standard?
3. In Philly, a garage parking spot in a building would be an additional $300-400 per month, is this the case in Miami? Almost all of the Zillow results say ""1 garage space"" in the amenity list, but do those spaces cost an additional fee on top of rent?
4. I understand using a tenant-rep broke/realtor r is free to the tenant, but how do you find a reliable realtor? Are there any reputable firms in Miami you could recommend?
5. Sorry to keep comparing to Philly but it's all i know. Usuallly here you start looking about 3 months before your move, when is a good time to start your search in Miami?

6892,1586728065,"Hello,

I‚Äôm a female in my mid-20‚Äôs, born and raised in NYC Manhattan. I work at a big media company ever since I was out of college. My long-term boyfriend, also born and raised here works in construction management. We‚Äôve visited Miami together a couple of times to see friends nearby, enjoy the beach and just for leisure. We obviously know visiting is different from living, but we absolutely love it there.

Due to the insanely high cost of living in NYC we are still living with our parents (this is extremely common for NYC young adults: a tiny 1x bedroom in a decent area goes from $2,500-$4,000 a month with no amenities or perks and many times you still need a roommate).  In addition the NYC tax is pretty high aside from federal tax which eats up my pretty darn good salary for my age. My bf also does well, we‚Äôre thinking of saving up at-least $20k collectively to move in 2-3 years, which shouldn‚Äôt be too hard since we thankfully don‚Äôt have to pay rent.

We want to take our relationship to the next level and have been talking about moving out of NYC to start our life together (together for 7 years). I can get a transfer at my job to the Miami area and my boyfriend is hoping to find one when the time comes, we will NOT move without job security. We also understand that Miami isn‚Äôt like NYC where things are open 24/7 and the city is not super upbeat/ fast paced. We are tired of overpriced, dirty, crowded places everywhere we turn. We would love a more relaxed setting with some perks of a city but overall less fast paced. My boyfriend can drive and owns a car, I am currently learning. A few questions for anyone who has made this move or live in Miami:

1) What would be the best neighborhood to live for a young couple? We aren‚Äôt looking to have kids anytime soon. We love bars, restaurants and fitness. We don‚Äôt need a ton of space.

2) We stayed at Collins Ave many times at an Airbnb. This is on Miami Beach, which I know isn‚Äôt downtown. Do any working professionals commute from this area to their job? How is it? 

3) Is a $2,500 rent maximum feasible for a safe and decent place to live? We would like a 1 bedroom, with preferably a gym and/or laundry + pool in the building. To get this level of comfort in NYC this would cost at least $4,000 a month (we know from personal experience from friends and family) 

4) Any other tips? Has anyone made this move and thought it was great or regretted it? We really don‚Äôt want to stay here forever.

I recently purchased this wonderful painting by Kyle Pulley ‚ÄúSNEAK‚Äù, a talented artist doing great work here in Miami. I have never before bought a piece of original art, but when I saw this creative tribute to the Freedom Tower, an iconic piece of Miami history, I knew I had to have it. Miami is a city constantly tearing ahead at breakneck speed. While this is a vital part of what has catapulted our community from a sleepy town on the edge of civilization to a global city in what seems like the blink of an eye, we have to remember to take a step back and appreciate our history ‚Äî it can teach us a great deal about where we‚Äôre going. This piece, titled ‚ÄúEmbrace Your Past‚Äù, perfectly captures this dynamic, combining the electric pulse of modern Miami with a living monument of days gone by. Be sure to check out Kyle‚Äôs IG page ([@prodigykp](https://www.instagram.com/prodigykp/)) for many more great paintings featuring some of Miami‚Äôs prominent landmarks.",Awesome painting featuring the Freedom Tower,1586637781.0

These false negatives are extremely dangerous because receiving a negative result causes people with symptoms to let their guard down, rejoin their normal activities, and go back to being physically close to family members. In other words, receiving a false negative can cause someone to spread the virus when they otherwise wouldn't have.

Here are some suggestions from someone who wears gloves occasionally to avoid touching or spreading the cooties or Fentanyl.

Are you practicing proper techniques that include taking off the PPE correctly? Wearing gloves is literally pointless if your taking them off incorrectly. You don‚Äôt take them off like you would with winter gloves.

[Taking off gloves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTYioOo__6U) (1:00 Duration)

[Taking off a mask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoxpvDVo_NI)  (2:37 Duration)

For those who want to drive with your gloves everywhere. Understand that whatever your gloves touch, will be spread in any surface you touch with them on, and so on. So if you leave your house wearing gloves, close your door, open your car door, touch the steering wheel, go to Walmart, push the shopping cart, grab your wallet, buy items, go back to your car and then do everything in reverse, you are bringing all those germs back to your house and every item you touched thereafter. Then, if you forget about it and touch your wallet or doorknob without gloves.. I call that the finger fucked oopsie. Clean your doorknob, car door and steering wheel frequently.  

Stop touching your phone with your gloves. Stop touching your hair or clothes with your gloves on. Just imagine that your gloves is infested with Sweet Baby Ray's Barbecue Sauce‚Ñ¢ and whatever you touch, you shall spread. Gloves are not meant to be worn literally everywhere. You‚Äôre indirectly exposing yourself and others. 

Also, I noticed an influx of gloves literally all over the parking lot of shopping centers. Like what the hell.",So you insist on wearing gloves and a mask everywhere you go. Heres some pointers from the oink oink! ‚Çç·ê¢. ‚öá .·ê¢‚Çé,1585538095.0

My boyfriend and I went to do some grocery shopping and as we're leaving we see three guys (a mix of workers and a security guard, I think) trying to hold onto another man who was demanding to be let go and to let him walk away. They had taken a backpack and kept saying he needed to come with them. They caught him right at the doors so our best guess was he tried to take something in his backpack and they caught him when the alarms went off.

By the time they were hauling him in there he was screaming ""my back, my back, it's my sciatic nerve!"" before finally breaking free and making a run for it. He got away while the workers and security guard walked back inside with the backpack.

The whole thing was seriously depressing to witness. The target employees are all in masks and gloves. A lady disinfected the self-checkout machine we used two seconds after we were done. They're trying to take precautions and here comes some asshole forcing three stressed, overworked guys to restrain him because he's trying to rob a grocery store.

Maybe he lost his job, maybe they're low on food at his house, maybe a lot of things. I didn't really get to see what he took. It's still such a shitty thing to do, but especially right now.",I think somebody tried to steal from the Target at Dadeland,1585346416.0

\-Is it worth trying to find a roommate? I know this further my options for places to live, but people are unpredictable &amp; Miami people are wild (love y'all)

Stupid me i had always believed that being born here with a family line reaching back made me a real American, included in all groupings including Americans.

Naive me at the tender age of 54 to understand that in a Global Pandemic and a National Crisis, to think 2 Trillion in bailouts would include little old me. But how wrong was i.

It appears that by giving me a thousand bucks would tip the deficit and topple our economy forever, so its best they have decided to leave me out of any relief. Notwithstanding i will still have to dart and flee a spreading deadly virus, i will still have to quarantine, and i might even fall ill myself if all else goes terribly catastrophic for me.

Our nations government have adopted communist party talking points condescending to the ""WORKERS"". Speaking repetitively using that ""W"" word as if in the USA all there were considerations for were a group of tools in the shed that would need any assistance at all in order to keep the machine of the Proletariat in motion. This btw excludes you if youre an old or a disabled and even if you fall into disrepair as a homeless veteran. How sad.

Do they hear themselves?

Two Trillion dollars is literally a mountain of currency. Yet not a pinch will reach us if we arent WORKERS. The airlines will get billions, the Kennedy Center for the Reforming Arts will get $25 Million many pockets will be lined, many off-shore accounts will grow to be certain, make no mistake.

If you read Reddit chances are you have way too much time on your hands. Chances are you are not a ""WORKER"" or even a real American. Not in the eyes of our elected officials. So you wont be getting shit for ""relief"" contrary they will add to yours and my own misery by orders of thousands instead of relieving any of  it.

# [SIGN + SHARE THIS PETITION NOW](https://campaigns.organizefor.org/p/flcovid)

We need Governor Ron DeSantis to immediately freeze all Rent, Mortgages, Bills for all Floridians who don't have thousands of dollars in their bank accounts and depend on every dollar, live paycheck to paycheck, to make ends meet. The bills are being extended to 60 days instead of being frozen so no one has to pay bills that continue to accumulate when Floridians need to focus on getting back on their feet. The State shouldn't be charging tolls making millions on the hour when all monies must be allocated for necessities.

The time is NOW, not tomorrow, we need an effective Governor to take action when it's needed.

**Why is this important?**

Our goal for this petition is to help all of Floridians during the Corona Virus outbreak who are facing hardship such as immobilization due to hospitalization, sickness, quitting their jobs, or being laid off.

But, for now, I'd like to have a discussion on the existence of ""neighborhood patrols"" or ""neighborhood brigades"" in Miami-Dade and Broward especially during this time.

I live near the West Kendall area.  At certain, particular times during the day and night, I have noticed the appearance of large SUVs and large pick up trucks -- both types of vehicles with completely tinted windows -- driving erratically around parts of this area.  By ""driving erratically"" I mean they stop and accelerate similar to someone who is lost and is trying to find an address.  Or, more precisely, someone who is driving around observing neighborhoods and residents.

Another disquieting occurrence is that these vehicles seldom, if ever, appear alone.  Typically, they appear in groups between two and four vehicles, each one observing a different area of the same neighborhood during a particular time.

I remember it looked like a city inside, with streets painted on the floor and chain link fences, traffic cones, stacks of tires, stop signs and traffic lights, and all sorts of other neat stuff. It kind of felt like a queue area for a theme park ride or something. It was very 90s.

But being a kid I don't think I ever even paid attention to the name of the store, and I certainly don't remember it today.

Also   


Air humidity in the health care sector requires a high level of attention, for instance in hospitals, clinics, nursing homes or even fitness studios. On the one hand, it contributes significantly to the recovery and the preservation of health, on the other hand it supports a high level of performance.  


In residential properties, the right level of air humidity contributes to the health of residents by minimizing illness and aiding to keep resident comfortable by eliminating dry eyes, noses, and throats.  


How Humidity Levels Affect Us...  


Illness - The transmission of airborne viruses, such as influenza, is significantly reduced at a humidity above 40%RH. Also, the mucous in our nose and throat is our body's natural defence against airborne pollutants. When it dries our immune system is weakened.

Trading **small quantities** will decrease likelihood of scamming and robbery. If you make exchanges, it will be important to be very cautious of disease transmission and criminal intent. Ask the people around you if they need help and make small exchanges if you can't sacrifice resources outright. Ask and offer people.

Post HERE and NOT in a new thread.",1583178361.0
8136,1583162905,"Hi all, your friendly neighborhood communist fascist authoritarian loser mod here. I wanted to take a few minutes to clear some things up and lay some ground rules down for the shitstorm that is engulfing Reddit thanks to the US election. So here are some updated and clarified ground rules, and some more insight into how we will be handling violations moving forward:

**Rules and Clarifications**

* **Be Civil.** This one should not need to be said, but we find that most of the posts that we remove and people that we ban violate this rule. Being civil doesn't mean that you aren't allowed to disagree with people or be passionate about your beliefs. It simply means that you do not call people names, insult anyone, use derogatory nicknames (for people on the thread AND for people not on reddit), etc. If you find yourself disagreeing with someone, by all means post your counterpoint. Attack their argument to your heart's content. But do not attack them as a person. If you cannot make your point without resorting to insults, consider whether your point is worth making in the first place.
* **Political Posts.** There is a place for posts about politics. This is not that place. If you need a recommendation about where that place may be, try Googling ""Where can I post political screeds on reddit?"" That said, this IS a place for political posts that are about Miami, deal heavily with Miami, or are of specific import for Miami. This includes things like discussion of a proposal to drill for oil in the Everglades. Or a candidate's visit or speech taking place in Miami. Or a candidate talking about Miami. Or a Miami politician. This does NOT include ""Anything that has to do with politics, because some people in Miami care about politics,"" or ""This vaguely talks about Cubans or Immigrants and we have a lot of those in Miami."" If it isn't primarily about Miami, it does not belong here. Before posting, ask yourself: ""Would someone in Miami find this more interesting/useful than someone not in Miami?"" If the answer is no, it does not belong here.
* **Racism, Sexism, or Other Discrimination.** It's 20-fucking-20 people. If you say anything that discriminates against another group of people, whether in a blatantly derogatory way or otherwise, you will be instantly and permanently banned. This is one of the few rules that goes straight to maximum punishment with no warnings or intermediate steps. You post something racist, you get banned. End of discussion. Any follow-up messages along the lines of ""But it wasn't racist because..."" will result in an immediate mute and ignore from every single mod. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT play this shit in here. Don't like it? Go be a racist on one of those shitty racist Reddit alternatives that keep starting up and going out of business. Please note, not all the mods are native Spanish speakers, so if you see something in Spanish that violates these rules, please report it.
* **Report Spam.** We get it - sometimes people post things you disagree with. That doesn't mean you need to report. Report spam violates Reddit's TOS, so if it turns into a bigger problem than it is, we will be getting the admins involved.
* **Everything Else.** This is not an exhaustive or comprehensive rules. There are also rules in the sidebar, along with Reddit's general rules and TOS. Just because it's not written here doesn't mean you've ""found a loophole"" (yes, someone has said that in the past.)

**The Moderation / Mod Action Process**

1. The first step for minor rule infractions will result in a warning and a removal of the offending post and \*may\* include a 24-36 hour temp ban. This is entirely up to the mod team who will decide on a case by case basis. Petty slapfighting will result in an automatic 36 hour ban for both parties.  

2. If you've previously been warned about anything, the next offense will result in a temp ban that can be from 3 to 10 days. The previous warnings do not have to be related to the current offense - we assume that if you are warned about something, you will be smart enough to read the rules and avoid breaking them again. And yes, we do keep a record of warnings.  

3. If you break a rule after a second time out/warning or you violate any rule in a way that a mod deems an egregious violation, you're gone to permaban town.   

4. If at any point you respond to a mod action with a shitty modmail or DM, you automatically get upgraded to a permaban. If you respond to a warning with a shitty comment, that's also a permaban. If you threaten, insult, whine, or otherwise act like an asshole in any way in response to a mod action, you will be muted and permabanned. This includes ‚Äúbut, but the other poster called me a \_\_\_\_\_\_ and you didn‚Äôt punish them!‚Äù Mod actions against other users are not up for discussion. If you feel another user has said something out of line, please use the report button.   

5. If you believe that the mod action against you is not fair or undeserved or you want it reversed, there is an appeal process. The appeal process is to send us a modmail (or respond to the ban message) politely requesting an appeal and clearly and concisely laying out the case for why you believe the mod action was in error. This will be looked over by a majority of the mods, and we'll vote on whether to revoke the action or not. We will try to respond to all appeals within 48 hours, but keep in mind that this is not our job - we are volunteers who have careers, families, and lives outside of Reddit. Also, see #4 - if your appeal message calls the mods stupid or is nothing but insults or petulant whining, you may as well not appeal at all.  

6. Ultimately, modding is a very subjective thing. We try to be as objective as possible and evaluate everything through the lens of Reddit's and /r/Miami's rules, but sometimes a mod action is a judgement call. You might disagree, and that's fine, but at the end of the day, in a subjective disagreement, we will go with the decision of the mods every single time.  


We want to encourage a productive, fun, and welcoming place for discussing issues important to Miami, and we don't want to completely stifle political speech. But we also don't want this subreddit to devolve into shit-flinging for the next several months. We'd love everyone's cooperation and understanding, and if you feel that some of the rules are unfair or need expanding or we need more/less rules, by all means provide feedback - we do actually listen to y‚Äôall and take suggestions into account. Thanks, and have a happy election!",Update on Rules and Mod Actions,1583177305.0
