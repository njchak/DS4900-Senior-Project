If you want to save a spot the night it snows a foot, and maybe if you are elderly that's fine.  If youre still tossing chairs and ladders in the street a week after heavy snow you are a clown, and a selfish person.  

I shoveled myself and my gf out 4 times and never saved a spot.  I also shoveled my whole alley the first storm so that my neighbor could get to work... then I'm stuck with no spot later that day.  We both have had to come home late after work and park illegally due to your SAVED SPOTS.  

It's a joke and I think it should be illegal.  It's public parking everyone should do their share and shovel a space and move on with your life.  If youre older or handicapped than make a sign and maybe block one spot idc. 

Idk just had to yell at someone because I'm an inch from walking down the street and tossing all the chairs back thru peoples living room windows.

But also, this is a very dangerous time.  There's a *ton* of ice built up over the ground.  Roofs, trees, all of it - and it's all going to start coming down as it melts.  

This week so far I've already had one friend whose car was totaled by ice falling off a building, and another who had a very near miss.  I expect there will be more to come.  And today, this happened to me as well:

https://imgur.com/a/CTwck0d

I had a 30+ foot column of ice on the outside of my apartment come down in the gangway.  Luckily, no one was out there at the time, but the neighbor's fence is not in a good way.  

So pay attention, look up, don't walk by walls more than you have to.  Check where your car is parked and move it if you need to.  

Good luck Chicago!"

I tried to get it out a couple weeks ago and realized the snow bank would be my biggest obstacle. How do people deal with this? I'm a single female and I will kill myself trying to attack it with a shovel. I know you can hire people for these types of jobs, but I also understand they are paid by the hour and ice can be a real obstacle (I'm afraid they'll injure themselves too). Does the city provide any services or help with issues like this or am I out of luck?

HOWEVER this is our first time using tolls and we didn't think of it. We did not know there was a 14 day period to pay the tolls and it completely slipped our minds due to everything being so hectic and chaotic. Luckily Illinois was the only toll area we went through.

So now we are trying to go through the IllinoisTollway site to pay it but cant select the dates that we went through. We cant call the phone number because they are closed on weekends. Is there somewhere else on the site we can pay the fees for dates of travel outside the 14 days? Or would calling the number on Monday giving them the dates and license plate number and doing it by phone the only way? We would like to pay this ASAP.

During his entire 1st grade year we have been virtual.  I accept that Chicago is a highly politicized environment with a deep history of unions.  I can accept that.  

But this morning it was his turn to read to his class and he read the “I read a dream speech” but instead of MLK, O’Bama was inserted everywhere.  What the hell is going on in CPS?"

Now of course winter is here and it packed a punch. The first wave of snow I wasn't concerned too much with. I checked up on it and there was a decent height. This second wave, though, has me getting worried especially since the citizen app just sent me an article about buildings collapsing. 

I'd have no problem shoveling it down a little, but I have no where to ""throw"" the snow safely. Googling an answer isn't yielding any relevant results. Anyone have an idea what could be done?"

So stupid question from a fairly new, somewhat returning resident. I live in a two story apartment building, on the second floor and I've noticed some fairly large icicles hanging from the roof, right over one of the main entryways to the building.

I know it's not super warm right now, but a couple of them look a bit dodgy, and I am concerned that some of them might fall and hurt someone. I can reach most of them from my balcony, but I am concerned that if I knock them down I may in some way shape or form exacerbate the issue. Or the ones I can't reach might be weakened by me knocking the others off and increase the chances of them falling later and hitting someone. 

I've tried to call the property manager but can't reach them.

Should I knock what I can down, or leave it be? Just worried as there are a few elderly people who don't move fast and don't want to see them or anyone get hurt."

Things that drive me nuts:

Slow drivers. Driving 10 miles under the speed limit is not only infuriating, it is dangerous.

Use your turn signal before getting to the intersection. How many times I've been stuck behind a car because they didn't turn on there blinker until the light changed 

People who leave a car length between them an another car while stopped at a light. Why do this? Who benefits?

When the light turns green, go! 

Would love to hear more things that irritate you about driving in this city."

But the worst part of living here for me is the complete chaos of being a pedestrian in winter! There are just layers and layers of ice that build up on the sidewalks. Most property owners (so weird to me that the city doesn't do this) are pretty good about clearing their sidewalks. But pretty much every street in my neighborhood has nearly impassible sidewalks that are an icy slippery mess. I've fallen so many times. Intersections with alleyways are often terrible. 

Am I'm a youngish healthyish adult! I can't imagine how it is for the elderly or disabled. Covid-19 seems to be making it worse as a lot of businesses that would normally clear their walks have closed and aren't doing so."

You may have thought it fun to surround my car with 18 inches of snow on all sides overnight. Forgive me if I offended you in some way by parking on the public way. You see, there were several cleared spots, and it was 8pm. Our street is never full, and isn't even zoned. I have never seen anyone participate in dibs here for those very reasons. I respect dibs, and wouldn't have parked there if it had been claimed. Last night we couldn't get to our garage, because we got stuck in the alley for 45 minutes on a snow bank. One of our *better* neighbors had to help push us out. Thank you kind sir for that. So I hope you can come to understand why we parked on the public street for which we all pay taxes. 

I respect dibs because I have access to a garage, and I know not everyone does. But if there is nothing claiming a spot, it is public parking. So thank you, Unhelpful Neighbor, for helping me to get my cardio in today.

If you want to claim a spot, just put a folding chair in it. And if you don't have a folding chair, feel free to come knock on our door, I'm sure we have something around here you could shove up your ass when you're not using it for dibs. 

Sincerely,

A Warwick Well-Wisher

UPDATE: Someone cleared the rest of the snow from where we were parked (I only cleared enough to get the car out) and now there are 2 plastic lawn chairs. It'd be a shame if something happened to them... JK. Like I said, I respect dibs when it's done properly."

I assume the obvious things such as masks being required and social distancing being encouraged, but I was hoping someone could tell me what the table situation is like (specifically Blackjack)? 

Do they rope off tables?  Do tables have reduced capacity?  Have the table minimums been effected?

- Warm up your muscles before starting.

- Shovel many light loads instead of fewer heavy ones.

- Take frequent breaks.

- Drink plenty of water.

- Don’t feel that you need to clear every speck of snow from your property.

- Head indoors right away if your chest starts hurting, you feel lightheaded or short of breath, your heart starts racing, or some other physical change makes you nervous. If you think you are having a heart attack, call 911 or your local emergency number

Please bear in mind that many of the people on r/chicago (like me) are former residents with siblings, friends, and aging parents who still live in Chicago. That gives the OP just as much standing to comment on the aforementioned issues, because while it may not affect the OP, it certainly affects the OP's loved ones.   


I do not live in Chicago anymore. I moved to where millions of former Chicagoans have also moved-Arizona. I think AZ is the REAL West Chicago because we grew up seeing the Cubs' Spring Training in Mesa, and longed for the warm weather whilst we gutted out February-April winter cold...  


* When I hear about carjackings, I worry about my 78 year old dad, my 71 year old mom, and my 30-something sister, who drive/commute on a daily basis. 
* I worry about my parents getting fucked by the City and the State when it comes to taxes.
* I worry about my parents breaking hips walking on the ice not cleaned up by Streets and San. 
* I worry about my sister being assaulted on the CTA because the CPD has gone Fetal because it's too risky to actually do their jobs anymore, and the inanity of forbidding law-abiding people from carrying weapons in the one setting they're direly needed-the L.
* I worry about the Catch-And-Release Criminal Justice system Kim Foxx has run for so long leading to people who should be detained at CCJ to be set free with no bond and no incentive to return.

So before you shit on people for not having a dog in this fight because they don't live there anymore, try listening to them first.

On the city website,  I registered and got a number but then logged out and can't figure out how to log in (they only have a sign up  sheet but you can't log in after you sign up). I checked the cook county website but the only options are 5 hours away from the city. Any tips for Chicago residents who are in 1b?

Also, people who do the bare minimum to dig their car out and then park in beautiful shoveled spaces (dibs'd or not), suck.

Also, people who leave their cars on the street with no intention of using them suck.  People who don't  need to drive and would rather let their car be snowed in all winter make it harder for plows to efficiently clear the streets and make it more difficult for others to park around their iced-in vehicles.

Why can't we all agree to be good citizens of our city and shovel our cars together when the snow stops tomorrow?  Bring a hot cup of hot chocolate, or mulled wine, or a nice cold Old Style and salute your neighbors while we all shovel together.   Thank your fellow Chicagoan for shoveling the walk in front of his house, and if you're fit and able, maybe offer to lend a hand.  

If fewer people were lazy about shoveling their spaces, we wouldn't need dibs.  

And yes, for those of your who love to complain on every post about there being too many cars and more of us should take public transit, you won't find any complaints from me.  But, that's not an issue we can solve in the next 48 hours.  Proper shoveling however...

I'm going to shovel a space I can be proud of, a space that when people drive by they will gawk at in awe, a beautifully empty space, and then when I'm finished, I'll leave it graciously open for my neighbors who also need to park on the public streets of my neighborhood."

She's been bothered once and we've been assaulted once in a week already... Clark's and Lake is horrible obviously... we tried to find a way to go there avoiding it but nothing seems safer.   
I won't be able to protect her and carry next to her soon since I'll have a job. 

We thought about taking the bus 82 and 21 but the bus doesn't seem safer to me, is it? taking the greenline would still make us go through Clark's is there any better/safer options?

I don't want someone pulling a gun on her alone. While it would never be super safe anywhere here, I don't want her to be sick every morning thinking about the transport."

There were about 8-10 vehicles with their hazard lights on, on the back windshields of most of the cars, they had identical decal that stated Heavy Chevy Truck Club. One of them even had a “funeral” note taped to it. At first I thought it was a funeral procession. But they were dangerously weaving between cars and changing lanes with no blinkers for no apparent reason besides to go even faster. Then suddenly one will pop up out of no where and join the group, but at an alarming high speed. I felt like I was just about to witness 5 different crashes around me in a matter of minutes. One car got back over to the left lane when he thought the group has passed. Then a random car that I guess was trailing behind was speeding like crazy to join up, unbeknownst to other drivers. 

I am new here. Is this something they do often? It was terrifying to witness."

This is my first year in Chicago, but 2.6k kWh seems disastrously wrong. I have a 1br, ~750sqft apartment that I live in by with me and my girlfriend who is here ~50% of the time.

I don't have a thermostat, but I have an area thermometer I try to keep at 68-69 degrees. I have a desktop computer that's frequently on and I work from home, but my bill was absolutely reasonable until the winter started - this bill is absolutely insane compared to last month's, even. The apartment building is fairly old, so I'm wondering if the insulation might just be _that_ bad.

Does anyone have any input? Should I call someone at ComEd to check things out?"

But this makes me wonder, is what she's doing safe? She plans to do this every midnight if the weather is good, where even it's magnificent mile the streets are empty. Shall i talk her out of doing this? Or do you think she's good she will be safe?"

If you guys could please send a message to your state legislators, we are actively working to get rid of the money bond system that is in play in Illinois. This does not allow people to be let off Scott free, But it makes it so that if you’re rich you can’t just pay your way out of a crime. However if you’re disenfranchised and can’t afford money bond, you don’t have to sit in a jail cell simply because you didn’t have the financial means to pay bond while you wait trial. Please follow the link in the description for an easy way to contact your state legislators.

We call every three days, ask for supervisors, waited for 2.5 hours on hold today, but no one can resolve this for us. We just got a $200 bill for November. We can’t afford to pay the (currently) $800 bill.

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

I am a city lover and vacation in cities around the world. I couldn’t believe how many new buildings there were plus new ones being built. I took the tour boat on the river that went west and saw brand new condos. I read people have been leaving Chicago so who is occupying all those buildings? Are they empty or full? Is it mainly the south side that is losing people? I also saw some vacancies in office buildings and storefronts. The city also didn’t seem as bustling as the 90s so what’s up with all the new buildings?

Then Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak was meeting with FDR in Miami on February 15, 1933. In a failed attempt to assassinate Roosevelt, gunman Giuseppe Zangara shot Cermak in the chest. From his hospital bed, Cermak would famously say to FDR, ""I'm glad it was me instead of you.""

Here is a letter from Anton Cermak's secretary to a Chicago judge thanking him for his friendship and giving an optimistic update on the Mayor's deteriorating health. It's typed on the hospital letterhead. Cermak would die 4 days later on March 6th. 

Just kind of an interesting piece of local history I thought I'd share. I dig the stamp and postage more than anything. Maybe 20 years ago my father found this and some other letters in a box in an alley by our home.

A few months ago, I had issues with my UI payments after moving. I did what everyone does, which is: call, then put myself in the callback queue. When I got called back months later, something went wrong with the line and I got hung up on. Which meant another few months of waiting, which was frankly not an option. I went through a few additional options and nothing seemed to work, so eventually I contacted my state representative.

This is what you should do: call your elected representatives, stay polite and civil, and ask them to follow up on your UI issues. My UI got turned back on within a week and the person in the rep's office I spoke to even followed up with me a week later to ensure everything got resolved. I got backpaid UI and my payments haven't stopped ever since.

Helping constituents is literally part of their job description, so make them earn their money. And hey, if enough of us call and (politely) bug them, maybe they'll institute a callback system that actually functions! Hope this helps everyone"

&amp;#x200B;

I hear many people talking about kids being together, socializing, and basically making it sound like they would learn like they used to pre-Covid.

The truth is, it will not be the same or even close. Kids will be sitting in front of their chromebooks and learning like they are right now. They will be wearing masks and will not be allowed to socialize. Depending on the school size, one bathroom break per day will be scheduled.

Any child who exhibits any signs of illness of any kind will be sent to Care Room. If your child has a runny nose and another child in the room has Covid, now your child has Covid too.

They will be sitting in the Care Room until picked up by a parent. The adult supervising children in Care Room will go back between different classrooms because she or he is most likely SECA who assists special education children. Now she is spreading the virus to immunocompromised children.

Lastly, teachers will be teaching both, groups: those in front of her and those at home at the same time.

If people complain about learning now, wait until this happen."

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

This is set to ""new"" since it's likely people may revisit this thread over the course of the week."

As far as music festivals go, I think the biggest question mark is Lollapalooza given its date and size. I think Pitchfork is just a little too early in the summer to come back unless they change it up significantly, but I think Riot Fest will be okay because it will be well after the general population is able to get vaccinated. We had farmers' markets this year, so those are the only things I feel are all but guaranteed to come back.

What are your thoughts?"

2653,1606234929,To the guy in the white COLORADO sweatshirt that took the long way home on Saturday:,1606249329.0,"We haven’t met, but I just wanted to make sure that you made it home okay. According to our Nest cams, you had quite a night. 

It all started shortly before 11:00 where [you can be seen dragging your Divvy bike](https://imgur.com/a/lTX3ZMR) through the street and attempting to lock it up to a traffic light pole. You were unsuccessful in locking it up, but you did engage in a 30 second wrestling match with the Divvy, and upon reviewing the tapes, it appears that you won. You then dragged the defeated Divvy to a nearby street light, and took another go at locking it. While also a failed attempt, it does appear that you came to some sort of truce. The Divvy was willing to be gently propped up against the pole, and you were gracious enough to lie down and fall asleep by its side. The two of you had a solid 25 minute rest, before [good guy white car](https://imgur.com/a/VEKuoXy) pulled over to check on you. Good guy white car spent a few minutes by your side making sure you were okay, before going about his night. 

A few minutes later you arose, shook it off, sprinted across the street, and walked towards our house. [With keys and cell phone in hand, you confidently entered our front gate, walked up our stairs, and entered our vestibule.](https://imgur.com/a/gaReEom). Admittedly, most of the houses on our block look the same, so drunk or not, I understand the mistake. After a healthy 2 hour beauty rest in our vestibule, [you exited the front entry with some groaning and expletives.](https://imgur.com/a/DiHroBN) 

At this point, you walked around to the back of our house, [and tried for about 5 minutes to get in with your keys.](https://imgur.com/a/TSg7csn) For obvious (or not so obvious) reasons, your keys didn’t work. [Exasperated, you returned to the front entry emitting groans and some canine-like panting.](https://imgur.com/a/ttt2QC5) [You reentered the vestibule and let out some farm noises and a very concerning cough.](https://imgur.com/a/FU4Frc1) My partner is convinced that you have covid, so you should probably get that checked out. Your keys still didn’t work on our front door, so you checked the back a second time, [before finally exiting through the front gate with a couple “fuck you’s”.](https://imgur.com/a/5mEMvh0) Not sure if you were mad at me, the gate, your keys, or your friends that left you earlier in the night, but I hope you found peace. 

Oh yeah, I almost forgot...in addition to some bodily fluids (not sure if urine or vomit), [you left a single AirPod](https://imgur.com/a/V9MCqhm) on the rug in our vestibule. The only thing worse than losing two AirPods is losing one, so DM if you’d like to pick it up. We have plenty of stills of your face that I won’t post for your sake, so proving ownership will be easy peasy. 

Stay safe, and please wear a mask the next time you visit."

However, I believe one improvement that could be made is to build a line or two which does not go downtown, but connects the lines in western neighborhoods.  For example, let’s say you live in Rogers Park but need to get to O’hare for a flight.  To get there, you will need to take the Red Line to the loop, then transfer to the Blue Line which will take you back north to Ohare.  That’s horribly inefficient.  There should be a line which goes from Howard that passes through the western neighborhoods, intersecting with all the L lines.  This would let you be able to get to the blue line while not having to connect downtown, and connect closer to your destination in the western neighborhoods.  It would also allow people who live by Midway airport who need to get to Oak Park to connect with the green line without passing through downtown, saving countless time.  Not everyone works downtown, and if you don’t, it can add countless time onto your commute with the current system of all downtown connections."

They said they live in Chicago or at least close to it. They said they have never seen anything dangerous, aside from a rare bar fight at worst, or erratic driving. A few said “I live in Chicago, never heard a gunshot.”

Chicago is such a historical city we all know of, and seems to get a bad rep for possibly hidden areas of the city. I heard the downtown is one of the nicest in the country, and has a homeless problem like many cities but nothing as out of control and sporadic like my near San Francisco.

One metropolitan area which has a less violent crime rate, but more weird, public middle class violence is Denver. At least Chicago doesn’t have a bunch of mass shootings at theaters, extremely random shootings in nicer areas, etc"

Well before the pandemic I was unemployed when my job closed down. I was on and off unemployment for a bit, so when the pandemic hit I used the rest of it, got the bonuses, went back to my normal low amount, and then got on extended benefits. All of my payments have been consistent, but suddenly my payments dropped by $100.

I called IDES and got a call back today (before my call dropped) and they told me my benefit amount changed; they couldn't really understand why except they might be trying to ""stretch my benefits"" for the rest of the weeks I have it.

Has this happened to anyone else? I really needed this money now, as little as it is. I've been unemployed since the beginning of the pandemic and I am suffering.

Thanks."

Ever since I moved here, I'm coughing throughout the day. Some days more some days less, but its pretty much every day now, and more frequent.  


Has anyone else experienced this? Is there some kind of allergen that is common here (particularly in the high rise apartments maybe) ?  


I haven't been able to see an allergist yet due to covid. They've had me taking flonase and it definitely does help to a degree, but I'd hope to eventually have more relief than the flonase affords me.

I know unemployment exists but that's a short term solution and unemployment gives so little that you can't really live if you have a family. how are people living through this right now?

&amp;#x200B;

Just counting up the restaurants I know of in Rogers Park and Edgewater, it's a small fraction of restaurants overall that have in house delivery.

&amp;#x200B;

The downside to capping restaurant fees via legislation is you punish restaurants that now rely on Grubhub for their entire delivery infrastructure. These services are a key part of how they gain business. Businesses pay fees to services they use based off of the value to their business, not our perceived value as the consumer. The bottom line is they wouldn't have been using these services if it weren't bringing their business value.  Any dentist or doctor subscribes to similar services to gain patients and nobody has told them their fees are too high, and they won't because these services bring value to businesses.

&amp;#x200B;

You can see this in action in Evanston already where they have already enacted these fees, Grubhub now adds a 19% service fee in to your order (in addition to a delivery fee, in addition to charging the restaurant 15%). But, it's not all restaurants, it's dependent upon if they rely on them for delivery. As a consumer you have no way to know this until you've added everything to your cart and are ready to checkout. In some cases the fee goes down to 6.25%.

[https://imgur.com/XBjjDYt](https://imgur.com/XBjjDYt)

&amp;#x200B;

They have done this in every city that has enacted such fee maximums, so it's about to happen in Chicago too if city council continues on"

I would like to ask a question about a passage from *Between the World and Me* (Ta-Nehisi Coates). In one passage, he describes the time he spent in Chicago, ""walking through its vacant lots, watching the aimless boys, sitting in the pews of the striving churches, reeling before the street murals to the dead."" 

I did search on the murals in Chicago and it seems there are many. some of which are dedicated to the dead. 

Would Coates be referring to murals on a particular street/block?  If so, would that be Little Village, and the murals are dedicated to ""Day of the Dead""? 

Or are the ""murals to the dead"" scattered here and there in Chicago? 

Also, is the phrase ""murals to the dead"" not awkward? I am not a native English speaker (and lives far away from any English speaking countries). I took it to mean ""murals dedicated to the dead"" but what would it mean to native speakers?"

Sure, but I know they won’t do anything.

Yet Chicago is the only big city that did NOT implement fee caps, any other major city has been capping fees since May! NYC, SF, LA, DC, Seattle, Philly etc etc WHAT IS CHICAGO DOING?

I’m looking for someone who would be willing to screen share or meet in person to help me with some react native screens.

I’m using a no-code builder (shoutem) for a rather basic app and am wanting to add a couple custom screens in. I’m pretty sure I have the code I want and need already (GitHub). It might be old though?

Either way, I’d like to do the work while someone looks at my screen and guides me through. I’d prefer this so I can learn and will be able to add small adjustments as time goes on.

If you’re interested please let me know and include whether or not you’d be okay with in person (if not, it’s obviously not a deal breaker right now) and how much your hourly rate is.

Thank you!

And then more cops just standing in front of the building. 

Just an estimate but if you have 100 cops making $70k/year working at least 3 12 hour shifts this week?  That’s a ballpark of about $130k or about $44k/day.

Trump Tower needs to pay for its own security. The condo building I live in has to hire private security whenever we deem it necessary. We don’t get police protection."

She was really trying to keep it professional. I believe someone ran up behind her and dumped a bucket of water or something on her in broad daylight and runs away.  The final moments of the video you hear a guy yell (perfect comedic timing) “welcome to Chicago”.  My god it was priceless but the reporter was simply mortified. I just remembered the video today and can not find it. Does anyone remember this video or where it may be?

Amid all the craziness, here's a benign post:

Dunkin Donuts has been offering a free medium coffee (iced or hot) every Wednesday for a while now, and they're going to continue the promotion through the end of 2020.

The only requirement is you download the app &amp; create an account. I'm pretty sure you don't even need to load money onto the app, or link a credit card (from what I remember).

There's rarely something that's ""truly free"" nowadays, but this is one of them! Makes me look forward to hump day every week.

I'm sure a few of you know about it by now, but I've been surprised how many of my friends haven't heard about it, and wanted to spread some good news.

Cheers!"

My gut opinion is that you transplants are all midwestern rubes who flock to the city closest to your suburban upbringing.

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

This is set to ""new"" since it's likely people may revisit this thread over the course of the week."

For safety reasons, we would like to get her car inspected as soon as possible, but we are struggling to find the right authorities to contact about this issue. I know that the state has given extensions for expired Illinois plates and inspections, but we're worried because her plates are from another state."

It's obviously free, but you gotta give me back the cards. We play on the northside. We smoke and drink, but not heavily, and you don't have to partake in either.

Obviously, we have all been mostly isolated, and would request that you have been similarly responsible. So, please don't be someone who is attending superspreader events (i'm sure you're not, but gotta add in something)

Even Foxtrots app declined to send alcohol after 9, in order to keep our city safe (per the popup on the app). Perfectly fine to order charcuterie items though. Totally get the concept behind the obvious, such as social distancing and even some of the themes under debate such as shutting down of indoor dining etc. But how does my inability to get IPAs delivered after 9pm fight this thing?"

So the place I get tested at posts their daily positivity rates. I have noticed they have gotten well into the teens throughout the week and seem to continue to climb a bit everyday. Their Lincoln Park location is now reporting a daily Covid positivity rate well over 13%, and Downers Grove location over 16%!

[https://innovativecorona.com/](https://innovativecorona.com/)

This is a lot higher than what [Chicago.gov](https://chicago.gov/) dashboard has it at just under 8% for the weekly rolling average in the city. I am afraid with these trends we can expect the city average as a whole to continue to go up and possibly means we may be going back into Phase 3 or even 2 again.

I will say if you need a test Innovative Express is a great place to go. Can make an appointment right online and either drive or walk up. They offer a rapid result test as well and antibody!"

My employer's LLC jurisdiction is registered in Virginia but they operate out of Chicago. I had been under the impression that I had to make an expense reimbursement claim as Illinois law mandates since that is where they physically operate.

Despite this, the company has refused to budge and give any kind of reimbursement. What would my next be? I have talked to HR who has given a vague 'we are looking into our policies' answer, but no actual movement.

They are only covering up to portion of a phone plan that uses 'minutes' on people's phone plan. If unlimited minutes, no reimbursement is provided.

Then, my sis grabbed some prepackaged meat from another good deli store, and it was packaged fucking 12 days ago

Today. I go into yet another different store and ask for high quality turkey. Get home, and it's on the verge of going slimy (bad).

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

This is set to ""new"" since it's likely people may revisit this thread over the course of the week."

The first time we are just sitting on the train and minding our business when someone walking by on the platform started staring at us. My girlfriend looked up and was immediately flipped the bird. Albeit, the gesture came with a somewhat humorous face, but still.
The second time we are sitting and waiting for our pizza to to get brought out. A guy bangs on the storefront glass and flips a double birdie. We were all completely oblivious until we heard the bangs and looked up. 
So.... is this normal? We are pretty average folks. All wearing masks. Non-descript clothing. Not exactly imposing individuals."

I miss my American car. I want to invite my wife to smith and the loyalist again. I miss skinner park and montgomery parc. I miss the water taxis to go to work during the summer. I miss big storms. I miss buffalo wild wings with friends to bet on some plays. I miss cheap UberX. Believe it or not, I miss my 6am flights to NYC on Mondays, grabbing my argo tea in terminal 2. I miss budy guy, I miss all jazz bars, and classical music at millennium Park, and jazz sessions at the shredd aquarium. I miss gyu-kaku on Ohio and cocoro on wells. I miss beach volleyball leagues on north avenue beach. I miss lake shore drive and sheridan road with my motorcycle up to kenosha. I miss blackhawks games. I don't miss Walmart though.  I miss do rite donuts and bert's cat wash. That's it. For today. Cheers and enjoy your city."

Homemade Polish Sausage from a woman named Katrina. Many nights she would be outside- whether the weather was hot or cold, serving the most decadent, intoxicating, late-night snacks to resuscitate a weary drunken soul. 

Does anyone have any information as to her whereabouts/ storefront, new location, delivery, etc.?

I’ve thought about her a few times during quarantine, and the cravings are getting more severe.

While relaying on the gig economy as my main source of income, my landlord allowed me to pay rent 3 times a month (1st, 10th and 20th) rather than once a month and that made a huge difference for me.

Curios if paying rent more than once over the month would help anyone else. Please reply with YES or NO.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

This is set to ""new"" since it's likely people may revisit this thread over the course of the week."

Do people from different parts of the state have distinct regional identities? What are the different parts of the state like? 

I feel so dissociated my state that it doesn’t even feel like I’m from here. It just feels so alien to me.

The app also claims no outages at my address, though it does show 51-500 people in my zip having problems. 

I find it hard to believe my modem just decided to give up the ghost the exact same day Comcast starts network upgrades, upgrades Comcast claim are finished. If anyone is having similar issues I can at least rule out my equipment. Only other thing I can think of is coincidentally the squirrels in my yard fucked over the cables or something."

For example today around 11AM the prices spiked to $0.35/kw [(Comed)](https://hourlypricing.comed.com/live-prices/), I've also observed the price spike to $0.20/kw at 2AM which also seems pretty random. For comparison the price usually hovers around 0.02/kw for most of the day. Regular pricing is around 0.05/kw. I doubt these spikes make much difference in terms of bills, but I wonder why these 10-20X spikes are happening especially since the weather is pleasant.
 
Prices during the summer follows a more predictable pattern. It would be higher during the day especially when it's hot, and tapers down at night. It mostly follow people's A/C usage pattern which makes sense."

&amp;#x200B;

1. It doesn't really help normal people. They market it is 97% of people will have lower taxes. Which is true.. but not really. They will lower their taxes by such a small amount. For example 
   1. I am making $50k. Under previous plan I pay 4.95%, or $2,475. 
   2. Under new plan, I pay 4.7% on first $10k, then 4.9% up to $100k. I pay $470 + $1960 = $2,430. 
   3. Great, you saved $45. 
2. It taxes single filers the same as joint. Why is this, every other item i've noted with tax usually has the joint tax income level double single filers. 
3. This does not hurt the billionaires. it increases tax on working families making &gt; $250k (doctors/lawyers, etc.) Can they afford it? Yes... but this isnt hurting the citadel folk making $10m, they have ways to reduce they taxable income. again, this ONLY looks at taxable income. 

Overall, this leads to Illinois (which already has a high tax rate), creating an even higher marginal tax rate. I would be for this if we created an ACTUAL progressive tax system (maybe 0% up to 10k, then 3% to 100k, 5% to 250k, 6% to 500k, 10% to 1m, 15% 1m+, etc) but it's not that progressive, doesnt save anyone that much money, and will likely lead to more people moving out of the state as many high paying business jobs can now be done remotely. I may still vote for it as I ALSO hate flat taxes, but dont think this is a huge improvement."

I completed all the steps necessary to begin working - passed an interview, passed a test, passed a fingerprint check. But when it came time for training...... They told me they couldn't rent a training facility.

WTF. The Census is mandated by the Constitution and they can't get a training facility. Then they should all be fired.

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

This is set to ""new"" since it's likely people may revisit this thread over the course of the week."

Any insight into what is going on here lately?  Is there some kind of beef.  I saw a reddit post from about 1 year ago with the same concerns.

Our HOA has no writing about the devices and I'm looking for what other peoples buildings say about them.

4840,1602350390,Anyone familiar with building codes or ever do a teardown/new construction for a SFH on the southside?,1602364790.0,"My parents have a 130 year old woodframe house (no foundation) that they've signed over to me and we've been thinking about tearing it down for years. I looked up some information on the RS-3 zoning that it sits on and I think I have a pretty good understanding of the front, side, and rear setbacks but the height is something that's puzzling to me.

The house is in one of those older neighborhoods where the street plumbing/sewage was done after the fact so the ""basement"" is above ground, but still below the sidewalk level. For example there are stairs that go down about 7-8ft from the sidewalk onto a path that leads to the back yard. 

RS-3 says that the max height for the structure is 30ft - so would this be 30ft from the level of the sidewalk? Or 30ft from the where the house sits (meaning that for me it would be 22-23ft above the sidewalk)? If we do a complete demo and re-build, will we have to ""fill in"" the lot until it is level with the street? If we don't and we build from the where it sits now, how does that affect the FAR (Floor Area Ratio)? I know that basements don't count towards the square footage, but would the bottom floor still technically be considered a basement?"

&gt;Exterior scenes for “The Batman” will be shot here next month, mostly in the Loop area, according to the Chicago Film Office. The movie, which stars Robert Pattinson as the titular character, has been filming in the United Kingdom. It’s unclear if the cast will be in Chicago for the brief shoot."
4880,1602282353,Transportation,1602296753.0,"Hello All

Need some advice- will be moving for a 6-8 month job at Stroger and would like to know if driving (and then parking 15 min away in the off-site garage) vs public transport (from Streeterville area) is best.  

My main concern is safety- with the frequency of night commuting since I’ll either be returning after a 12 hr day shift or going to a 12 hr night shifts.  I did a similar commute in NYC for years but was a local; I’m a total novice in Chicago (and yes, I know what Stroger is like)...

It’s not ideal either way since I walk with a limp and use a cane due to an old injury.  

Any info on anyone with a car looking to be a driver- lemme know!"

I really shouldve taken pictures, if for no other reason than to prove I’m not insane, but they’re usually gone within a couple of days. I wasn’t smart enough to take a pic last time I noticed one.

4889,1602274549,Minimum Paid Sick Time,1602288949.0,"Hey everyone!

I am a Chicago resident. I currently work remotely for a company based in LA. The company currently does not offer me any paid sick time hours. I mentioned the minimum sick time laws in both cities, but was told by my employer that the company has an ""unlimited sick time"" policy and since that policy is more generous, they are exempt from this requirement. 

Under this policy, employees request leave and can take as much as needed, as long as it is approved. As most of the employees are salaried, this winds up being paid time. However, as an hourly employee any sick or vacation time I request and take is unpaid. Therefore, it would seem to me that the plan is not more generous when it comes to hourly employees and that I would be entitled paid sick leave. 

I am looking for advice in terms of my legal rights as they relate to this policy and what I should do moving forward if I am entitled to sick time and my employer refused to offer it. I’ve tried calling/emailing 311 and Dol in Chicago and Illinois, but haven’t been been able to get a response due to covid staffing levels.

Do I need to just contact a lawyer here? I likely don’t have the funds for that. Any ideas on a non profit offering aid?

Please let me know if I can provide any other information. Thank you for your time!"

I couldn't see a filming rig, but maybe that was the black SUV. I saw one car with a small camera mounted over its windshield.

Sorry, no photos. I was driving, and the median blocked all but the tops of the cars from view."

4995,1602165545,PSA regarding subtleties in the proposed Fair Tax implementation,1602179945.0,"PSA: I've noticed a lot of people lack a good understanding of the proposed tax brackets for the fair tax initiative. I think it's important to point out that Illinois barely distinguishes between filing jointly vs filing separately. If you're married and filing jointly there's a good chance you will pay more tax - even if neither of you make more than 250k. The cynic in me suspects this is an intentional obfuscation on our politician's part, as most people see the commercials and think ""I don't make more than 250k!"".

Here are the bracket proposals:

    Single                      Married
    4.75%   &gt;   $0              4.75%   &gt;   $0
    4.90%   &gt;   $10,000         4.90%   &gt;   $10,000
    4.95%   &gt;   $100,000        4.95%   &gt;   $100,000
    7.75%   &gt;   $250,000        7.75%   &gt;   $250,000
    7.85%   &gt;   $350,000        7.85%   &gt;   $500,000
    7.99%   &gt;   $750,000        7.99%   &gt;   $1,000,000

Let's take a simple example to demonstrate how this impacts a married couple filing separately vs jointly. John &amp; Lisa each make 150k and file as individuals. Bill &amp; Jane each make 150k, and file jointly.

    John pays: (4.75% on 10k) + (4.90% on 90k) +  (4.95% on 50k) = 7.36k
    Lisa pays: (4.75% on 10k) + (4.90% on 90k) +  (4.95% on 50k) = 7.36k

    Total they pay: 14.72k

Compared to filing jointly as a married couple:

    Bill and Jane pay:  (4.75% on 10k) + (4.90% on 90k) +  (4.95% on 150k) + (7.75% on 50k) = 16.06k

    Total they pay: 16.06k


In addition the the above, the state also sneakily converts the progressive tax to a flat tax at the 750k threshold. Granted, this impacts very few people, but it's still absurd complexity in the proposed tax changes. With a progressive tax, earning a dollar extra is always a good thing (even though that extra dollar may be taxed at a higher percentage than the dollar before). However, in Illinois, if you make $749,999.99 you will pay significantly less tax than if you made $750,000.00. This is because at the 750k level, Illinois decides to tax all your prior income at the higher 7.99% rate.

Just wanted to throw out some of the subtleties involved in the proposed income tax changes. Choose wisely my friends!"

I live in in the city and own a car, as do my roommates. Unfortunately, it’s becoming really hard to find parking on my street, which is pretty expected. However, lately we have noticed influxes of people with no city stickers or even state plates parking on our street for weeks at a time. We’ve also seen an increase in super long work vans parking for weeks, too. As healthcare workers who work late night shifts, this is super frustrating as it seems like they’re doing so because they’ve faced no consequences. I hate to be “that person” but is there anything I can do other than go door to door trying to ask people to move their car? It seems unfair that people who paid for stickers and permits are struggling to find parking while others just take advantage. I’m sure I’m not the only person either."

5134,1601929895,Witnessed a random brutal attack in the museum campus last night,1601944295.0,"TLDR; A young girl was repeatedly hit over the head with her own skateboard in a seemingly random act of violence. 

I was walking through the museum campus after the Bears game last night around 8:30PM, on the west side of the Field Museum northbound.  I went up to the little garden area with the dino to snap a few pics, when a person in a hoodie ran past me from the south.  I was surprised to see somebody up there running through, but really didn't think much of it.  Literally 1 minute later as I continued on towards the path near the LSD tunnel just north of the museum, I could see off in the distance by the curve somebody swinging an object over their head.  I hustled over to see what was going on and a young girl (late-teen or young 20s) was huddled on the ground, getting pummeled in the head with her own longboard by the same person who just ran past me...so hard the board broke in half.  As I approached, the assailant chucked the board and ran off through the tunnel under LSD, and a couple other people came up, including her friend (I think) also on a skateboard. The girl was badly hurt and her head was covered in blood, but conscious and able to scream for help. I'm almost certain she would've been killed if nobody else was around. Took the bike cops and ambulance almost 10 minutes to show up. 

Unfortunately nobody got a good look at the assailant in the hoodie.

If anybody is close to this story, please DM me.  I'm pretty shaken up by what I saw, I want to know if the girl is OK and if they ever caught the punk. 

Yet another psychopath running loose in the city.  Stay vigilant and keep your eyes and ears open at all times."

But it’s been close to 40 years and I no longer remember the details. Can anyone fill in the gaps in my knowledge?"

Cps students are talking virtual classes for the 2020-2021 school year. They are expected to be on screen for 8 hours a day. With COVID-19 cases still rising it’s clear that it’s much safer to stay home, but 8 hours of staring at the screen is not mentally and physically healthy for students.  
It has been shown that not only students are being affected but teachers as well. Being online for so long has caused mental and emotional stress on everyone. Even when classes end, students still have homework and teachers need to prepare for their upcoming lessons. This just means more screen time and more stress.  
We ask that school hours online be shortened. If online school was to be 4 hours, students and teachers will have more time for schoolwork, personal lives, and themselves. They have families to take care of, responsibilities, jobs, etc. It’s important to realize that this new to everyone, students are having a harder time learning and teachers are having a harder time teaching. The excessive amount of hours only makes it more difficult.

Please sign this petition to show your support to shorten school hours. "

Quick question regarding the quarantine states. I might be traveling to Wisconsin next weekend, which is on the quarantine list. I've told my boss this and he said it's fine to just come in and I don't have to worry about the quarantine. Is this legal? Can he force me to break quarantine? Can he fire me if I tell him that I'm going to quarantine?

I also can't really afford to quarantine if they don't allow me to work from home while I'm quarantining (they're stupid about this)... Aka no pay for two weeks. In which case, I'll probably say no to the Wisconsin trip.

Thanks everyone."

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

In light of current circumstances I'm going to be moving back to Ireland for the time being after 2.5 amazing years in this great city. 

My lease runs through June and the landlord is toeing the line that I'm responsible for getting a tenant to replace me and covering the balance until they've moved in. I empathize with him but I'm also not in a very strong financial position myself. 

I've listed the apartment on a few different sites, even for less rent than what I'm currently paying but there is almost zero interest. 

I'm not familiar with local city / state tenancy laws, can anyone advise me on what my options are?

The title to this post is ridiculous, and you likely asked yourself: ""Who the hell rents engagement rings at the last second like that?""

Unfortunately, I do. I had a ring re-size job done and the company fucked up monumentally by forgetting to ship the ring immediately when the order was done. This will result in the ring being delivered late (Monday).

I have rented a venue and this has led to a problem, in which friends and family from out of state are already coming and I HAVE NO FUCKING RING NOW.

So, I have to save face somehow. My girlfriend was made aware of the details yesterday and is in full support of taking this approach (lost the element of surprise, yay).

## **How to Register to Vote**

Anyone who wants to vote in the election must first register to vote. The [Chicago Board of Election Commissioners website](https://chicagoelections.gov/en/register-to-vote-change-of-address.html) has a lot of great information on how to register. A few important things to note:

* The deadline to register to vote online is Sunday, October 18.
* You can still register to vote in-person at your polling place, both during early voting and on Election Day. To do this, you must bring two (2) forms of ID - [check this list](https://chicagoelections.gov/en/when-you-need-id-to-vote.html) for requirements.
* If you have registered to vote in the past and need to check or update your registration, [click here to check your registration status.](https://www.chicagoelections.gov/en/your-voter-information.html)

---

## **Voting By Mail**

As COVID-19 continues to keep many of us at home, voting by mail has become one of the most popular choices for many Americans across the nation. Requesting an absentee ballot makes the voting process easier by giving you more time to make your voting decisions at home, as well as saving you from having to wait in line at your polling place. Anyone who is qualified to vote in Chicago is able to [apply to vote by mail](https://www.chicagoelections.gov/en/vote-by-mail-application.html) if they wish to do so. For detailed information on how to vote by mail in Chicago, [click here.](https://chicagoelections.gov/en/vote-by-mail.html)

* If you apply before September 24, you will receive your ballot via mail between September 24 and October 5. 
The last day to request an absentee ballot is October 29.
* USPS recommends mailing your ballot back at least one week before Election Day to ensure it is received on time. However, Illinois will count ballots that arrive through November 17 as long as they are postmarked by November 3. It is strongly encouraged to return your absentee ballot as soon as possible to ensure it is counted. No postage is required for returning the ballot via mail.
* If you prefer to return your ballot in-person, the City of Chicago will be placing secured drop boxes at every Early Voting location. A list of all early voting locations can be found [at this link.](https://chicagoelections.gov/en/early-voting.html)

---

## **Early Voting**

If you want to vote in-person but wish to do so before Election Day, early voting is a great option to avoid long lines and last-minute obstacles on November 3. [This page](https://chicagoelections.gov/en/early-voting.html) contains detailed information on early in-person voting.

* Early voting starts on October 1 at the Loop Super Site only - address and hours can be found at the above link.
* Beginning on October 14, early voting will take place in all 50 wards plus the Loop Super Site. Please visit the above link to see a list of every early voting site per ward.
* Early voting will continue through Election Day - Tuesday, November 3.

---

## **Voting on Election Day**

In the 2020 election we have a myriad of options for voting early, but if you want to vote on Election Day, you are welcome to do so. To vote on Election Day, you must go to the polling place assigned by your registration precinct between 6AM and 7PM on Tuesday, November 3. [Click here](https://www.chicagoelections.gov/en/your-voter-information.html) to find out where to go vote, and see [this PDF](https://app.chicagoelections.com/documents/general/document_464.pdf) for a preliminary list of Election Day polling places.

## **So, who should I vote for?**

Well, that’s up to you. But if you need help deciding, there are a number of resources to help you make an informed decision:

* [Illinois Voter Guide (Paid for by the League of Women Voters of Illinois)](https://illinoisvoterguide.org/)
* [Chicago Sun-Times Voting Guide](https://elections.suntimes.com/voting-guide/2020/)

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

This is set to ""new"" since it's likely people may revisit this thread over the course of the week."

So I'm really sorry I acted like a dick. I'd just like to explain.

I was stopped at a red light zoning out to music and someone started yanking on my door. Its always locked. I was shocked this is happening, so I looked at him and said ""wtf??"" My windows were up. He did the ""I can't hear you"" hand gesture and pulled the door again. At that point I grabbed my knife, flicked him off and speed off.

It didn't even occur to me its saturday night and people are Ubering home from bars.  I had a bad experience on Lake St under the Green when I actually did almost get carjacked. But still, my bad. Hope I didn't startle you too much.

Btw, I'm not going to add any more details. This was so random that if it was you, you know."

What am I missing here? Of course my email purges deleted messages after 30 days, so I dont have the email confirmation from the city, but I do have the transaction data in my credit card statement. I paid for this through the online portal. Has anyone seen this before? I would prefer not to double-pay this ticket since the city already siphons off enough of my income.

I was at a Damen bus stop. He was just lurking around me. I knew he misinterpreted my shirt, I knew he thought I was a conservative.

He was lurking around me, kind of circling me as if to say, ""Fuck you for wearing that tee shirt! Fuck you for the Republican Party.""

But suddenly, he stopped and said, ""Well you must have been really liking the Trump convention on TV huh? Watched on Fox, huh?""

So I said, ""Dude, I worked on the West Side of Chicago and taught in the Bronx for 15 years. I was often the only white guy in whatever neighborhood I lived. You own a fucking tee shirt. Go fuck yourself."""

Does the actual cleaner take pictures of the vehicles or does another vehicle go by beforehand to take pictures? Wondering if I got lucky this time or if I should expect a ticket in the mail in a few weeks. 

Thanks in advance!!"

Dan's can be a jerk and a bully, but not always.   He's very honest, outspoken and uncompromising about his support for racial justice.  And he cares about the community.  But Dan is very very ill and will die without intervention. 

Despite his great talent, he been fired numerous times.  And sadly he has long documented and admitted drug addiction and mental health issues.  He degrades women and talks about porn all the time on aire, so porn addiction.  And gambling issues.   

And he's STILL DRINKING, see image from one of his tweets last month.  So a meltdown was inevitable.

Everyone knew this, and all the newspapers and trade journals talked about the risk.  But 670 wanted more of the populist Ditka market.  They fired the thoughtful black (Jason Goff) and Jewish  (Matt Speigel) talent.  Instead 670 hired McNeil, who  they knew would revert to the meathead mentality when on the air.   

And it worked for a while.  670 shot past ESPN for #1 sports talk in Chicago.  But now they are an embarrassment."
6194,1600290866,Pickup Trucks on Lake Shore Drive,1600305266.0,"Hi All - I'm planning on buying a small pickup (Toyota Tacoma) and I've been researching restrictions on driving it on Lake Shore Drive. I spoke to my local police district and they said that it was a complicated issue. On one hand, the letter of the law says that vehicles with Truck B plates aren't allow, as that is technically a commercial plate, but that the law is really about vehicles being used for commercial purposes, which a personal pickup wouldn't be. He said that he couldn't speak for the districts that patrol the Drive, but that it wasn't really a Police priority.

So I then called the Sec of State's office and asked whether a truck below 8,000 lb. GVWR needed a B plate and they said yes. So I then said my current car has a branded plate (for my college), could I just transfer that to my truck. They said that if the truck is below 8k lb, yes. Which would mean avoiding the B plate issue altogether. Gotta love IL.

My question is has anyone ever had any trouble driving a personal pickup on Lake Shore Drive?

tl;dr: Has anyone had any trouble with restrictions surrounding driving pickup trucks on Lake Shore Drive?"

All cars that enter the congestion charge zone in London have to pay £15 to drive there, like a toll, with all of the money being used for London public transit systems. The rule in London has exemptions for cars that meet certain emissions standards like EVs and hybrids, exemptions for people who need to seek medical care and can't travel by public transit, steep discount discounts (like 90 percent) for people who live in the area and other unique scenarios. 

It seems to me like it would solve issues of congestion and increased emissions downtown, encourage more people to use the CTA and give the city an additional revenue stream solely dedicated to CTA infrastructure. What do y'all think?"

I'm currently at the point where I need to get a vehicle for work and family purposes (have a grandparent in the suburbs who needs to be checked in on now every so often who is willing to split payments) and I'm wondering if having these unpaid parking tickets is going to prevent me from registering a new vehicle tag and/or stop me from getting a city/neighborhood sticker?

If there was anytime this guy could strike again it would be now since he could freely walk the streets without suspicion while wearing a mask. Its a scary case that this guy is still out there on the streets. Maybe he got rid of his gun already and there would be no way to trace the murders to him, but I hold out hope that someone will hear this guy bragging about murdering people in a bar one when he's drunk and then they can release the information to the police. 

Has anything changed in Rogers Park since this set of murders?"

The final video is going to be about 2-3 minutes long, and all I need from you is an interview and some footage of you doing things (putting on drag/performing something/a hobby/things like that I guess). 

Honestly I’m not sure if I’ll be in Chicago or Syracuse when it comes time to film so that’s why I’m calling for people from both places. This will be shot on an iPhone XS (I know, real fancy equipment. We love a pandemic) and I will follow social distancing guidelines.

I just moved to Chicago, but the downtown and river north and mag mile and entire north side is doing a lot better than most other cities, I can tell you that. The pandemic and civil unrest are national/global issues that are pummeling every city with impunity. Chicago is not especially bad in this regard and everything I've seen so far has led me to believe that I made the right choice in coming here.

Rent prices are half of what they would be in comparable areas (SF, NYC), the economy is hurting but there's still foot traffic and activity and life, the food is amazing, and as someone who works in the finance industry, I can tell you that no, the rich are not fleeing the city in drives out of fear of rioters."

Indianapolis resident here. I’ve been camping a lot with all the covid and I think I’ve blown some fuse with seeing trees. I now feel the urge to be engulfed in city buildings, if that makes sense. More than ole Indy can provide. I’m thinking of driving up in a week or so for a day trip. 


Basically I’d like a spot where I can park my car and just sort of gawk for a good while. Perhaps trek away from if for a beef sandwich. Maybe get a couple fun night photos of the buildings. 


In the past when visiting, I was almost always there to play a show at a small bar, had many in the party, and never deviated much from the mission at hand. So I’ve not much experience inside the loop (or thereabouts), OR rolling solo.


tl;dr
Ideally, a parking garage in the thick of the city with roof parking, a 24hr system for entry/exiting, and a reasonably low chance of getting messed with is what I’m looking for.

The very same instructor literally asked her students to ""take a screenshot"" (I heard her state this) of a classwork, which is a hard copy (textbooks were distributed earlier this month). Flustered students asked how to do so only to be snapped at and left in the dark. Okay so I assume she meant to ""take a photo"", which I'm happy to assist my 2nd grade child with only guess what, this isn't the issue...turns out she never posted a submission link. 

There are endless threads of students asking repeatedly that an assignment posted has no documents attached or instructions with no response by the teacher. It's evident that none of this is the fault of the students. My poor child would be in tears and we've made every effort to reach out to the instructor/school with no response.

I could go on with many other instances, but the general consensus: whaaaaaat tf.

In the last month alone I've seen 5 roaches, mostly in my bathroom. I've never seen it THIS bad before but it's getting out of control.


Is this a good enough reason to break a lease and how difficult would it be to break a lease through a management company (specifically Kass, if you're familiar)."

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

I had a *wild* idea last night that could serve as some humorous light in these not-so amazing-times. I’m a huge Jurassic Park fan and thought how hilarious would it be to get one of those fan-powered dinosaur costumes or a non-inflated dino costume and ""run amuck” downtown while bringing awareness to wearing masks: “Don’t let you, your family or your friends go extinct. Wear a mask!” or something along those lines. You get the idea.  


My gf, who works at NM, said we could also likely arrange a time with Lurie’s childrens hospital to move in herds outside past the hospital so the kids and staff could see the dinosaurs. People could also act as “victims” being chased if they didn't want to wear a costume but would, of course, need to wear masks and keep socially dino-distanced.  


I’ve reached out to some family who are on board but wanted to gauge interest on here, too. I like the date of 10/10/2020 since it sounds neat, it’s a Saturday, and it’s before Halloween and will likely be cooler then. Again, this is all tentative depending on interest, but I hope there will be plenty of it to see this through!  


That being said, I don’t know if this would end up requiring a permit or what have you, but I’m willing to do the research since this keeps cracking me up the more I think about it or if there are legal/permit experts out there, please share your knowledge. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tentatively thinking of meeting as a herd close to Luries and then ending at the Bean.

As you see I'm not exactly in Chicago yet but I fell in love with this city for time I touched down. I wanted to live somewhere that had a happy medium of city life and suburbs life. 

I was looking at NYC but I think I will honestly get lost in the sauce so Chicago was next on my life and littrally fulfilled everything I could ask for in a city from night life, roof top bars, good food and much much more. 


As a 24 year old female who is about to finish undergrad, I realized dating in Colorado (where I'm currently located) is just not it. I've decided to be single until I move up to Illinois and begin dating again and putting myself out there. 

With that being said I'd like to know how is the dating scene out there?"

I went to the Melrose Park location. Diversey is closed for some reason and I figured Elston would be packed, so I tried the burbs. Decided to get there at 6:30am. It was a 30 min drive out there, and when I arrived the line was already at least 50-75ppl deep. 

That being said, once they opened it wasn’t that bad, and I was out of there by 9:00am. They pulled some folks out of the line for specific services. I was getting my license renewed because I needed a new vision screening, and decided I may as well get a Real ID since I was already there. Ironically, they are waiving the vision screening requirement for anyone under 70 due to COVID, but I still would have been unable to renew online. So it was sort of a pointless trip due to bureaucracy but overall was not the nightmare I expected. 

Go while the weather is nice, you’re well hydrated, and have earbuds. The lines right before the deadline are bound to be awful."

I just setup a group in Chicago and scheduled the first event for Thursday 9/17! This meetup group is all about learning D&amp;D in a welcoming and friendly environment. If you've ever wanted to learn and experience the magic of D&amp;D, please consider joining. We have a pretty decent community growing with fellow newbies and I'd love to see you at a game! Games are run every other week and they're always free and open to everyone. We will be playing virtually on Astral Tabletop using Discord (which supports both mics and webcams).

Here is a link to the Meetup group: [https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Dungeons-Dragons-Newbie-Sessions/](https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Dungeons-Dragons-Newbie-Sessions/)

Games fill up pretty fast, but it's still worth RSVPing because sometimes players drop out and slots open up. There will also be plenty more games to join in the near future!

Thanks for reading and hope to see you there!

The treatment: He created a fake email with a cartoonish level of white sounding name like ""Trevor McCovington The 8th"" or something.

Results: **21** out of the 34 people responded within 24-48 hours. 8 responded after 72 hours. 3 did not respond.

I was driving through illinois on my way down to Tennessee. I have an Ipass, and used it for all the tolls except one. I was in a really congested area, trying to take an exit, and got stuck in the wrong lane with absolutely no way to move over, so I ended up driving through a cash toll lane instead of an ipass lane. I dont know the number of the plaza, so I was wondering how I can pay it? Since I have an Ipass, will they just put that toll on my Ipass account after running my license plate? 

Thanks in advance guys."

I’ve lived on the west side of the city for the past ten years and while it’s always been difficult to find apartments that welcome my 60 pound pitbull it has become increasingly difficult since the gentrification of this overall area. (Currently in UKV). 

That said I’d love to hear if anyone has a great landlord or PM company that allows pits. We need to move out hopefully before December when my whole landlord raises the rent again. She’s a good girl and is really just a chonky marshmallow. 

Please help me I love this dog and I’ll never leave here but searching for companies that allow pits is seriously exhausting. Fuck dog racists, and human racists.

I'm an ICU RN with a MSN degree from DePaul and thought it'd be ideal for a diversity of professions and fields so we can really cover all fronts.

We were going pretty fast and I didn’t want to slow down the pace. Probably should’ve tailed her to the end instead of getting in front. Did it because the wind resistance was pretty high and it felt unfair to be behind the whole time (it is harder in front).

Could anyone point me to groups or organizations who are actively acquiring additional housing for the homeless in advance of a winter in which choices will likely have to be made between deadly cold and deadly crowding? I've been looking for a couple of months (couldn't volunteer because my contagion group included an immunocompromised person), but the closest I've found is Habitat for Humanity. Don't get me wrong, they do good work, but they seem to have more of a long-term focus. The winter of Covid, meanwhile, seems like a very specific threat that I would think ought to be addressed specifically. Maybe constructing temporary structures or refurbishing empty buildings to accommodate the increased spacial need brought about by social distancing?

I am sort of in shock here. I haven't been able to get the total cost of our plan to see how much the employer is covering, but I see most Cigna plans are pricing us over 1K, if we bought privately.  Maybe his employer is footing $350 or so and I should be grateful? And maybe this is the new normal for employer provided insurance that I need to get used to?

The last time we got insurance in Chicago we were self-employed, did Obamacare and qualified for subsidy, paid maybe 300 a month? Our income level won't let us qualify for a subsidy anymore.

I was bringing groceries home and while passing a Green Line train stop, he starts to approach me, laughing, asking ""Where you goin' with them Timberlands"" over and over again. I swerved to ignore him because he wasn't wearing a mask and I didn't want to engage. He was yelling and cackling to his friends about my boots even when I was halfway down the block. 


Is there some cultural aspect to Timberlands that I'm missing? I just thought that they were a winter/construction/working shoe, and they're comfortable to walk in. I got mine second hand but I know they can be expensive; I'm just lost here."

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having trouble understanding what I'm liable for under the lease extension agreement for my apartment. I am listed as a tenant, however, under the terms and conditions clauses I never signed the extension agreement, the two other people I live with did. 

In this case if I were to find someone to occupy my room and move out, I would no longer be liable for the lease at all-- my two roommates that signed the lease extension would be? 

I ask because I currently am moving out Sept. 1 and our friend is taking over my room and paying rent through January 31st as he is hoping to move back east after that. For this reason we are not going the subleasing route. Once the person I found to occupy my room leaves am I still liable to find someone to occupy the vacancy? 

&amp;#x200B;

I moved to a big city some years ago and it's been great, but I've struggled with finding like-minded people locally. As a result, I ended up quitting my job and spent the past year creating a tool (link: https://www.kardius.com) to hopefully solve this.

I did try meetup.com, but very few of the groups really resonated with me as many of my interests are either niche or online. I'm also kind of shy and would rather chat for a bit before meeting up with a new group of people.

I posted it in a couple of other places so far (e.g. [/r/entrepreneur](https://old.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/i6sg6n/many_people_here_in_the_past_couple_weeks_have/), [/r/rust](https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/es3ya9/finished_my_first_rust_project_a_website_built/), and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23959303)), and they really liked the idea, urging me to try reaching out to local communities, so here I am!

You first swipe on cards to show how you feel about polarizing topics like Hunting, Polyamory, Podcasts, Anime, Parties, etc. You swipe to the right if you support it, to the left otherwise. You can also list your interests and then filter posts and users by criteria like distance, similarity, activity, interests, age, etc.

You can use most of it without logging in, so no pressure at all to create an account. I hope you like it and would love to hear any feedback that you have so I could make it even more useful for you."

I was in Chicago for work last October and had an amazing week. I picked up a shot glass (one of my traditional mini-memoirs of trips).

I've just moved house, and unfortunately, this shot glass was one of the casualties.

https://imgur.com/Glefi23

I was wondering - if anyone lives near or goes down the Magnificent Mile regularly would mind popping their head in to grab one &amp; post to me? It was either ""Bye Bye Chicago"" or ""I Love Chicago"". I can reimburse you for shipping + the cost of the glass, and send some British sweets in return as a thank you.

Thanks in advance for reading and/or your help!

Take care Chicagoans

I have two kids and my wife stays home with them. It would average around $5200 a month take home, after taxes, insurance and such. I have the option to be 100% remote, but that isn't really my jive after COVID dies down. Having said that, it does give me the flexibility of living a bit further out if need be, perhaps in the burbs, if necessary, as I could just commute 1-2 days a week for meetings and the social aspect of an office and such.   


I've seen cost of living stuff online, and looked around a touch, but I don't know the area well enough to know what things would actually cost, and if I could actually make it work.

We have no car payments(paid off), and no debt, but I'm not sure what we'd need to survive in the city, not in the burbs. Also how is living in Chicago proper with kids? When I spent a month there back a few years ago I loved it. Didn't want to leave. But I was single, no kids in site."

I can no longer park my car on that side of the driveway because it'd be too close to the scooters and a family member may hit it coming out the garage. 

I also live in a dangerous neighborhood and am nervous about drug addicts or kids with nothing to do just possibly being around my house longer than needed. I've already had my car vandalized and shit so I don't want anything drawing more attention to the property."

It’s very obvious the huge damage it has on family owned businesses but don’t laugh at the idea of big names leaving the city. 

I work for a big retailer that’s been looted twice. For each looting our insurance deductible has been over $2 million. Yes a whole $2 million. To put into perspective the store would have to have a year and a half of steady business to make that much money in profit. So after the 2 lootings it will be 3 years before the store makes enough money just to cover the deductibles. Talks of  permanent closure have also come up and it will be a guarantee thing if it happens again.

Just thought I’d throw some of that information out there since it seems like a lot of people don’t think there will be long lasting impact to businesses in Chicago (especially big retailers)"

I was at a Damen bus stop. He was just lurking around me. I knew he misinterpreted my shirt, I knew he thought I was a conservative.

He was lurking around me, kind of circling me as  if to say, ""Fuck you for wearing that tee shirt! Fuck you for the Republican Party.""

But suddenly, he stopped and said, ""Well you must be really liking this convention on TV now, hh? Watching on Fox, huh?""

So I said, ""Dude, I worked on the West Side of Chicago and taught in the Bronx for 15 years. I was often the only white guy in whatever neighborhood I lived. You own a fucking tee shirt. Go fuck yourself.""

&amp;#x200B;

One thing that sticks out to me is section 4 of the ordinance itself

 **SECTION 4. This ordinance shall not apply to any existing rental agreement that expires less than 90 days after the effective date of this ordinance.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Does that mean that any lease that expires August 1st, September 1st and October 1st 2020 don't apply and these lease holders can just be given a standard 30 day notice?"

I'm trained in FDM and SLA forms of printing. I'm more than capable of leading a team and in fact work much better when I can lead others. I'm highly organized and prioritize efficiency in a manufacturing environment. 

I have proficiency in Solidworks, Fusion 360, Maya and Houdini. I am a quick learner and can learn new skills on demand. 

All I ask is good compensation. 3D printing PPE is very personally rewarding but it doesn't pay enough to keep the lights on. Feel free to PM with any inquiries.

I got an email today that I was over my data-cap. I had no idea they had a datacap as part of their plans, they don't seem to highlight it anywhere, I guess it's in the small print.

So anyway I was looking at the past few months internet usage, and due to the heavy data-load of my job (video-editing type stuff), I'm about 3x over the data-cap currently per month,

Luckily Xfinity weren't charging for overages from March through June due to Covid so I'm only out $20 at the moment (had some time off July/August), but looks like I could be charged $100 extra a month from now on. And it doesn't sound like I'll be going back to my office anytime soon.

Here's the catch, there doesn't seem to be an unlimited plan available for my area code? Is this a con? How can they do this? NY and LA my mates have unlimited internet.

I'd happily pay some extra for Unlimited but $160 a month total sounds a bit crazy to me.

Ultimately I'm sure I can expense any overages through work, but I imagine people who are self-employed/freelancing must get hit by this?

Is this the norm here? Any workarounds?

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

This is set to ""new"" since it's likely people may revisit this thread over the course of the week."

Is this a scam? apartment hunting.,1598215549.0,"Hi, I found a listing on craigslist in the sublets &amp; temporary listings for an apartment that is claiming to be a 1 bedroom 1 bath for $1100 all utilities included and a parking space for no extra cost. It is fully furnished. The price for the apartment seems a little low compared to other available units in the building.

&amp;#x200B;

 I contacted the individual and asked to schedule a viewing; they said due to the pandemic they are working remotely and cannot show the apartment. They sent me a virtual tour of the space. I live nearby the apartment so I did drive by it and could confirm that the unit on the outside is identical to what I was shown. I won't pay anything or sign anything before getting to see the unit with my own two eyes of course, so I'm going to stress that during my phone call. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, there is an $800 security deposit that is refundable 14 days to the end of the first month of move-in. I have set-up a call with this person to get more details about who they are. 

I spoke to another person who is renting out a similar unit, and it is priced at $1350 for a similar plan. He confirmed he is the owner and that other units are being rented out by the owners as well, so that put me a little more at ease. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can I confirm that this legit? 

Thanks all!"

It has been CTA's policy to not mandate Masks for passengers, only for CTA employees. CTA doesn't wanna enforce the rules they have set forth for passengers because, they are afraid of retaliation by a passenger who may either destroy or damage CTA property or harm a employee. Honestly it comes down to money. CTA doesn't wanna flip the bill for the property or the Workmen's Compensation claim, that will undoubtedly follow.   

Our Union, Local 241, has to stepped up by asking all the Operators to sign a petition for Mayor Lightfoot and Gov. Pritzker to help encourage CTA to mandate this rule. It has been weeks since we have signed the petition, yet no sign of a change. 

I'm asking for this discussion, to hopefully gain support from the public, in a attempt to get this rule mandated for all of our safety.

But when I look at costs for modems/routers online, decent modems go for around $60-90 and routers seem to be $100+ with a massive range (some going $250-400). It seems it's generally past the yearly price of renting. I've also heard they might need to be replaced every 3-4 years or so.

What's up with this massive range in cost? It definitely seems like purchasing your own is the better investment, but that upfront cost is pretty high. I'm only getting a one bed, so maybe I don't need the most expensive ones that are coming up, but I'm curious to hear what others' experiences with modems/routers is and how much they cost."

*The nurses’ current three-year contract with the hospital expires Monday. The nurses, who are part of the Illinois Nurses Association union, say they want the hospital to set limits on the number of patients assigned to nurses. They voted 995 to 12 in favor of a strike.*

*The nurses have not set a strike date, but they would have to give the hospital at least 10 days notice. Bargaining started in June, and more sessions are planned for today and next week.*

*The University of Illinois Hospital sits on the city’s West Side, serving many low-income patients, and has 462 beds.*

8073,1597802904,"Cyclists, do you split lanes in Chicago traffic?",1597817304.0,"I used to cycle in NYC with my brother and he taught me the thrill and seemingly accepted practice of splitting lanes when riding a bike through backed up traffic. I'm talking about passing cars at a red light in order to get to the intersection without having to wait behind a bunch of cars for the green light.

Today, I did this at a red light and sort of fucked up. The light turned green before I got to the intersection and I went in between the cars in the forward lane and the cars in the right turn lane. I sort of steered a little into the right turn lane in front of a driver who was about to accelerate to turn right. They honked (I deserved it) and now am rethinking this practice as it could have gone a lot worse.

That said, splitting lanes is one of the greatest joys when riding in a city, especially when you get to leave a traffic jam in the dust. And I've done it many times without any issues. I'm thinking if I continue to do it, I'll only do it in the right shoulder of the road.

So, cyclists, do you split lanes? Any tips of how to do it safely? Or should I abandon the practice altogether?"

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

I‘d be curious to hear from someone who has lived on one of these blocks or has experience with a block club - in particular:

1. What activities is your block club involved in? (I.e. block parties, neighborhood surveillance, etc.)

2. Do you think the block club significantly improved the safety on your street?

3. How widespread are block clubs? (I can’t seem to find any numbers, which makes sense as most of these seem to be more informal groups.)

I’m open to all replies but especially interested in South Side areas like Grand Crossing, Avalon Park, Auburn Gresham and South Shore. Thanks!"

Sure having a skill and working in analytics for corporate has its merits but so does the cashier dealing with humans to have your snacks or groceries scanned and given to you.

At least 42 people have been charged with felonies after hundreds of people tore through the Magnificent Mile and elsewhere in the Chicago early Monday morning, looting stores and clashing with police, according to the latest figures released by the Cook County state’s attorney’s office Thursday.

The charges include one for attempted murder, 28 for burglary and looting, six for gun possession, five for aggravated battery or resisting a police officer, and one each for theft and criminal damage to property, the office said.

In one case where State’s Attorney Kim Foxx’s office declined to approve felony charges, police detectives “concurred’' with the decision, according to the statement.

Earlier this week, Mayor Lori Lightfoot pressed Foxx to make sure there would be “consequences” for the widespread looting, which virtually shut downtown Monday morning as bridges were raised and trains were stopped to control the unruly crowds.

“Our expectation is that this is going to be treated with the level of seriousness it should be. Period,” Lightfoot said.

Foxx has been criticized as being too lenient after the lootings earlier this summer during the fallout from the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. After the mayor’s news conference, Foxx pushed back with her own a few hours later, insisting that her office approved charges for the vast majority of looting-related felony arrests.

I know they’re doing temp checks, but like do people actually wear their masks in the gym while working out and social distance because I’ve heard some people only wear the mask at the door and then take it off.   I’m specifically wondering about LA fitness (where I have a frozen membership) because before COVID my gym (and literally every LA fitness I’ve been to) was notoriously dirty but I always put up with it because the membership was cheap.  Can anyone who’s been to a gym provide since March some insight?  Thanks."

If anyone has any official drawings or pictures that they can share that'd be wonderful.

Gainfully employed by a corporate F100 company and in the process of applying for grad school. I'm originally from a similarly sized (a bit smaller) Southern US city and moved to Chicago this summer.

Why do I preface this post with my life story? Because without that context, I'm 100% certain I'd be labeled as a ""gangster"" or ""thug"" that is an apologist for all the looting that happened last night and the night before.

It seems as if my presence nearly everywhere in the city is seen as threatening. I get stared down casually minding my business in restaurants, stores, etc. I've had people see me on the sidewalk and immediately jaywalk across the street. I've given out a friendly ""hi"" on elevators and have been ignored on multiple occasions.

I've been a member of this subreddit for a few months while planning my move (primarily using the search function), however, now that I'm here and reading the comments under a lot of current posts. It's sickening and it's easy to see why I get this type of treatment from so many people in this city. When you see a post with double-digit upvotes that reads ""THE BLACKS OUR RUINING OUR CITY"" in the looting mega-thread, it's hard to feel welcome here.

Just something I've noticed in my few weeks here. Your generalization of black people is extremely disheartening and IS racist, whether you like to believe it or not.

Most articles posted online only mention the street known as the Magnificent Mile but if you watch your local TV news stations you'll that the scale of it extended into many neighborhoods in the city and impacted many stores. It's much worse than what's coming through most online news sources.

At a quick glance this looks like a lack of Police presence, and some are even beginning to make the case that it's time to bring Federal Agents in, but I believe this could have only have started online through social media and the Federal Government is the one to blame for this.

**There was no clear trigger for this and somehow hundreds looted multiple stores all in the same night. There is no way such organization could have occurred without the help of social media and its the Federal Governments responsibility to monitor such activity and track down threats.**

If the FBI, Homeland Security, or NSA can't detect something as widespread as an organized vandalism event brewing online (with hundreds involved) then maybe we should focus on that rather than how many bodies are patrolling the streets."

- Lori just interrupted and said to a reporter ""don't bait us, people are concerned for their safety and this is serious"" when a reporter was trying to bait the Supt into saying it's the same group and shit as June."

9002,1596991594,Stay Off the Northside Beaches,1597005994.0,"Hey guys; I felt I needed to make this post after friends who work out on the lakefront as trained Lifegaurds (now ""Social Distance Embassadors"") have told me about their both hilarious yet concerning lakefront stories of harrassment by mostly middle aged,  and (we'll say) ""privledged"" individuals up North upset they can't go onto the beach.

Summer's here, and sadly due to the virus the beaches have been closed most likely until the end of it. Lifegaurds and other park district city staff were left jobless for a 2-4 months before being given back their positions. 

If you go to the lakefront, you will see gaurds patrolling empty beaches, as they are ensuring that no one decides to go into the waters (people have actually drowned from playing in it off hours / ) or sand. Entrances are closed off and guards tend to remind you nicely that this is a strict order enacted by the city. 

However, many Chicago residents, especially those who live in high rises near the lakefront up North, have decided to either ""protest"" (a couple of Karens, not an official protest), go onto the beach in droves despite being told nicely various times, and have even gone as far as to be destructive and verbally harrass the guards just doing their jobs.
 
Guards need to focus on preventing drownings,  have made actual rescues already, but have also been unable to save others who either were limited on time or chose to swim afterhours.

Looking into it, there's actually a lot of issues being caused by people's blatant negligence to just stay off the beach or remain by the pier like everyone else does. For example, Kathy Osterman Beach staff have actually been trying to revitalize the grassy, natural area in order to not only preserve wildlife but also ensure the beach does not shrink. Many of the residents who live nearby and claim they have rights to the beach (either because of tax payer money or because they think paying for a lakeside home means you own the beach) have stepped all over these grasses just to cut in and out of the beach when the entrances are closed off, and they may not grow. 


Another is the water hazard. Waves have crashed and already flooded over the piers along most of the lakefront, including by Lake Shore Drive. They have become much more tumultuous, and have posed drowning risks for those who choose to go in. E. coli and other bacterial overgrowth in the waters may also be prevalent and while usually harmless can be unpredictable and could make people severely sick with ingestion. Foster, Osterman, and Margart T Burrows are the beaches that tend to have the highest bacterial E. Coli colony levels (Colony Forming Units or CFU per 100ml of water) in summer, and the levels only rise with ideal temperatures and lack of treatment.

And finally. Of course, COVID-19. I dont think this needs to be explained, but this is another big hazard. 
 
Please keep your distance, enjoy the air and sun, and let the Lifeguards do their jobs. Keep off the beach please, and tell others gently to be considerate that we are still in a pandemic with other varying risks when choosing to break the law."

\-I have a valid Wisconsin drivers license. I do not want to change it to an Illinois license at this time because there's a pandemic and I don't want to go sit in a government office for two hours

\-I want to buy a car sometime in the next few weeks. I'll likely be buying it in Wisconsin, but I may buy it in Illinois

The scenarios I'm trying to figure out are:

\-If I buy it in Wisconsin, titled in Wisconsin with WI plates, can I get a Chicago city sticker? Or do I need to get it re-titled in IL/get new plates? I assume the latter, but the bigger question is if I'll even be allowed to do that because:

\-Am I allowed to own a vehicle titled in IL **at all** if my license is a WI license? Or do I need to get the IL license to make this work (will I even be able to buy a car in IL, or transfer a WI car to IL?)"

Maybe someone should investigate why the mayor had a private birthday shin dig including alcoholic beverages on the rooftop of city hall for her birthday during the time people are being slaughtered in the street yet again including the gold cost rap murder. How much did this cost the tax payers to prep the rooftop for her birthday celebration.... research that.

The rental company I lease from only wants to give me a 6 month lease renewal. I am wary of committing to something for that long given that I could be moving out of the city in a few months time and don't want to be locked down for that 8 month period if possible. I'm exploring sublets and other short term options involving moving out, but while I'm doing that, is anyone aware of any Covid provisions that would aid in negotiating a shorter term lease with my current landlord?

I have a big dog, so I'm trying to avoid couch surfing even though I actually enjoy it, but I don't think the pup would.

Thanks for any help you can give!!"

My wife and I are trying to get our 1 year old out to explore the world on weekends while we can.  For instance, we went to the Brookfield Zoo (like 50% maskless, we were uncomfortable, not going back), and the Lincoln Park Zoo (way better, went twice and will totally go again).

We were thinking about trying the Shedd this weekend.  My daughter loved it the last time we went pre-pandemic, especially those wonderful belugas.  But it's inside, and we're worried if it's more like Brookfield, we just won't feel comfortable walking around.  Has anyone been there, are people actually masked up?"

9235,1596657333,"Archdiocese of Chicago reiterates plans for full-time in-person learning, with an alternative remote option",1596671733.0," Source: an email from the Archdiocese

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;August 5, 2020  
&gt;  
&gt;Dear Catholic School Parents and Guardians,  
&gt;  
&gt;This morning, Chicago Public Schools (CPS) announced a change in their planned reopening of school buildings. They have chosen to conduct classes via full-time remote learning for the first 10 weeks of the fall.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Archdiocese of Chicago believes strongly that our reopening plan, which provides for full-time in-person learning, is in the best interests of children and our mission. In-person learning is essential for the intellectual, emotional, physical and spiritual growth of our students. Our reopening plan maximizes the safety of our students and employees while allowing the resumption of in-person learning. It is therefore our intention to remain committed to our plan to offer five-day, in-person learning in addition to a remote, e-learning, option for those students who are unable or whose parents are unwilling to return to classrooms.  
&gt;  
&gt;In designing our reopening plan, we consulted guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as input on safely reopening and important mitigation efforts from the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH), state health officials and infectious disease experts on our own task force. CDPH has recognized that our school system is different from CPS and supports our specific plan to reopen. If this guidance were to change, we would adjust our plan accordingly.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the meantime, schools are working hard to implement health and safety requirements ahead of the start of the year. Schools are also preparing a virtual learning option with support from the Archdiocese. More information about virtual learning will be released to parents in the days ahead.  
&gt;  
&gt;I realize this is a time of anxiety and stress. Know that we deeply care about the needs of our child and are looking forward to the year to come. If you have questions, I encourage you to contact your school’s principal or the Archdiocese.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for your partnership and trust."

I get the feeling that another lock down is going to happen or at least all of the mitigating measures that have allowed things to open safely will be impossible due to weather. People

 will be too pent up and start parting inside, maskless in numbers together. Also we’ve all had a taste of re-opening and I don’t think a lot of people are going to go back to bring as careful as they were before.

I see that the Trump Tower condos are way cheaper than comparable condos in River North (saw a studio there for $150,000 on Zillow), and I was wondering what can explain this discrepancy? The only two things that seem unique is that: 1) It's associated with Trump; and 2) The rooms are very hotel-like. 

Other than the above two factors, are there alternative explanations as to why the prices are so low? From what I can tell, the building itself is relatively new, and, despite a slightly awkward entrance, the location is pretty prime."

I’m certainly guilty of having a hometown bias but I think the Sears Tower is the most classy and beautiful skyscraper in the world, granted I haven’t seen them all though. 

Growing up in the 80s when the Sears was still the worlds tallest building I always felt a sense of pride in that. Not unlike the pride of having the greatest basketball player and Greatest running back in football. As if I had anything to do with it. 

I love that if you’re driving into the city from the west on Roosevelt or North ave the Sears is always dead center on the horizon like a beacon. 

I find it odd when a tv show or movie has an establishing shot of the skyline and they focus on the Hancock instead. Seems really strange to me. 

I’ve always had a strange affinity for this amazing building. Not quite sure why. 

Anyone else love the Sears?

Note: forgive my rambling random thoughts."

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

This is set to ""new"" since it's likely people may revisit this thread over the course of the week."

Take the f*****g mask off your face”. (I was wearing a face mask due to Covid-19). 

I was obviously stunned and very frazzled. Oddly, the guy then coolly walks into Trump Tower. I followed him to the building and the security guard tells me “oh yeah he is a resident”. Now this guy was obviously very drunk and probably under influence of drugs too but it still scares me that people like him are in downtown! Obviously it could be an empty threat from a drunk stupid guy but I am still very rattled. I would have probably ignored the incident if this came from a homeless guy but to think that someone who lives in the Trump tower would make threats like this scares me. I didn’t press the matter but feeling quite unsafe and disturbed due to this incident. Any advice?"

I’m of the mind that the Lincoln Yards development should be made into community gardens and dedicated to public space. So much of the physical space in modern cities is privatized and the amount of time you can spend somewhere is in one way or another dependent on the amount of money you spend. 

People need a way to connect with their community, come together, and engage in practices that actually contribute to their well being. Lincoln Yards is a prime area to serve as a true public good, which is severely lacking in our time.

We now have just found out that an airbnb type company called Goathote bought the unit next door and are renting it out dirt cheap and saying it can sleep 9!  Naturally this has become a party house and there's routine yelling and screaming and once in while fighting until all hours of the night.  It'd be bad enough as is but with quarantine and working from home it's even worse and we're looking to get out and break our lease. Our management company has taken the line to contact Goathote and they will tell the current renters to keep it down(which is obviously both inefficient and ineffective)  Does anyone have any experience like this or any advice? Thanks in advance.

This used to be the paper of Royko and Ebert. Indeed, they still run old Ebert reviews because they don't seem to have any real writers on the staff. How pathetic is that? You gotta keep publishing the work of a dead guy because he snagged your last Pulitzer.

And did you ever notice that all the writers who do their own pieces seem to be old white men? 

Wow, isn't that progressive. Hey, let's buy a newspaper and keep all the old white guys, that nobody wants to read, and let's fire our entire photography staff because, you know, they might win a Pulitzer or something.

Anyone else feel the Sun Times might have been better off going down the toilet 3 years ago? 

Readership dropped from 300,000 to 100,000 within a short time. Why are we still killing trees to put this crapola out there?

Hey Sun Times? Times are changing. You can't get an African American man or woman to write your page 2 for you? No Latinos can write Sun Times? Come on. 

All of this is my opinion and all of you are welcome to share yours. But honestly, what's the point of keeping this paper as bad as it probably ever has been?"

9821,1595959986,Affordable Vets in Chicago?? Please help,1595974386.0,"I am kind of desperate, I've been looking for a new vet to take my puppy to. She was diagnosed with Isospora parasite and the vet I took her to (the Logan Square Animal Hospital) didn't do anything but rob me of my money. 

They lied to me and first gave my puppy the wrong medications in a few weeks span, TWICE, and it didn't cure her, and then when they finally gave her the Antibiotic they only gave her ONE shot and said it would cure her... 

She was fine for a while but its two weeks later and she's still too small and her gums have turned white from Anemia. I'm sure it's the parasites coming back. I can't afford another 50 dollar exam fee and another 60 dollars shot every time, Please I am looking for an affordable vet or a way to pay, thank you if you help me."

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

I am familiar with bypassing locks and going up fire escapes. Preferably looking for something downtown starting at 13 stories. I did some research and got a bunch of bs like “cindys bar” and restaurants. i am not looking for public areas like restaurants but stuff more like construction sites, parking lots, rooftops that have a roof that is attainable, etc... I am also a photographer and if anyone would like to private message me some cool photography spots / rooftops so that they dont get revealed feel free. i have currently only been on the roof of lake point tower (73 stories) thanks.

This might seem dramatic to some, but if the Ricketts family continues to use the Cubs brand to push their political ideology, I will have to consider abandoning the Cubs. I just can't abide that they are supporting a politician that is outwardly hateful towards so many. 

I don't like to mix politics with my love for baseball and the Cubs, but the Ricketts have forced the issue. Is anyone else thinking seriously about how to voice their displeasure with how the Ricketts are using the Cubs' platform?"

10091,1595683580,What is up with all the rats?,1595697980.0,I live just outside the city and never really understood how bad the rat problem was until yesterday. I had to start work extra early yesterday at 5am in Wrigleyville. I parked my truck around 430 and was waiting for work to start and the amount of rats I saw freely roaming the streets and sidewalks was disgusting and horrifying. I counted at least 8 of them in the half hour I sat in my truck. In my opinion this is a huge public health risk and I’m appalled that more is not being done to combat the infestation. These were not small rodents either. I may be exaggerating slightly but some of these rats look to be the size of possums. The idea that these things are feeding on any of the restaurants and fast food joints food makes me sick to my stomach and not want to eat any of the food from these establishments.

10253,1595524571,Neighbor's Central Air Unit is INSANELY loud - help,1595538971.0,"I'm wondering how anyone may have dealt with a similar situation.  
My next door neighbor's central air unit sits in between my building and their home so everyone on one side of the building can hear it. I'm on the second floor, and it's pretty close to my bedroom window which is the main issue. This thing is LOUD and wakes me up when it kicks on every night. Imagine someone turning on a vacuum cleaner under your window at 1 AM. Last night it ran for about 3 hours straight. You can hear it throughout most of my apartment when it's on. You can hear it from the sidewalk out front of the building which is at least 60 ft from the unit. I see these units all over my neighborhood and they're virtually silent in comparison.  


I need to go have a talk with them and let them know the thing is destroying any chance I have at sleeping through the night, but there's ZERO chance they're not aware of how loud the thing is to begin with. At the very least I need to get them to come have someone take a look at it because any rational person would hear it for about 30 seconds and know that it needs servicing. Has anyone successfully dealt with a situation like this?"

I’m really frustrated by the lack of deep reporting on these events and don’t know where else to look.

My grandpa, an inspiration in my life, secretly had a young life growing up in Chicago playing at nearly all black bars which he kept as a family secret.

Listening to him play in his older age, he inspired me to play piano and was one of the kindest, most honest and loving people I've ever met. He was ashamed of his bar life past, yet it was his inspiration to bring joy through piano and incredible music that spanned bar-room ditties and boogie-woogie adaptations. I've read and watched a lot of informative content regarding Chicago's boogie woogie roots and would love to know as much as possible from anyone who knows or lived through this amazing period in American history. 

Please share your stories. Share the music. Share any crazy tales from those amazing times. I miss my grandpa in these hellish times and I hope your stories will bring me some hope. Humbly yours, some average dude.

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

This is set to ""new"" since it's likely people may revisit this thread over the course of the week."

I am in a creative writing group and one fun thing we’ve been doing is creating “flash stories” where we get assignments on Fridays and share them by Monday. My assignment has a setting in Chicago— and I’m trying to write a character who is a baseball fan. I would love to know more about the stereotypes or typical personalities of the fans of each team— if there is anything there at all! I’m from Boston and our fans def have a famous reputation. Is there something like that in Chicago? Any help would be awesome. 

Thank you!

Edit: I’m so sorry— i selected the wrong flair! Not sure how to change that.
Edit2: I figured out how to fix the flair!"

Has anyone ever purchased the taxes of a home in Cook County and how long did it take before you were awarded the deed? Also thinking I may have to pay 2018 and 2019 taxes to possibly take ownership of the property. Any insight would be helpful. Thank you."

A quick search on *IDES*, *Keybank*, and *fraud* confirms—dozens of cases exist. 

I froze my credit reporting, and got my annual credit reports. One of the 3 agencies listed a soft credit check from IDES a week ago (from a Deloitte office in Minneapolis), otherwise the scam started and proceeded eminently smoothly.

I called my state representative, trying to find out a contact person at IDES to report the fraud. I couldn’t complete my first sentence: once I said “Keybank debit”, the nice assistant finished my narrative. Mine was the fifth report in the last two days.  Their office was batching the complaints for delivery to IDES.

As for how the scam is structured, it seems that the criminal just calls Keybank and reports not getting the debit card, then changes the address on his IDES account to match. New card in hand, he either buys stuff or sells card at a discount. 

As a victim, you gotta be proactive. IDES eventually picks up on the victim’s apparently fraudulent activity, and comes after him for restitution."

I've begun to think about doing a short term stay for a year in another state, until things wind down with the virus. I have over a year left on my current lease and am worried about trying to break it because I don't think they have much incentive to find a replacement when there are already some vacancies in my building. Am I wrong to think that trying to break my lease and have them find another renter is a doomed cause? Are there other avenues as a Chicago tenant that I can look at in regards to breaking a lease?"

&amp;#x200B;

I just moved to a new building in Uptown and my car was involved in a hit and run on the block of 815 W Montrose Ave. I got clear dashcam footage of the sideswipe (which hit the car in front as well) and went down to the police station to make a report and they seemed unhelpful. I called before I went there and the person that answered was helpful and explained that we'd get the report started and it'd be followed up by an investigator and that's who I am supposed to share the dashcam footage with. When I went, the officer that took my report asked me if I was there to see the incident and I replied no but I have the footage and clear image of the license plate of the offender. She then asked if I **needed** the report if my insurance was going to handle it. She reluctantly took it and I'm not exactly sure if I'll have an investigation followed up with. Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I'm taking the video for now. I was told that the offending car could sue. Thanks everyone for the help, I reached out to the claims department of my insurance and they're going to try to pull the license plate and see if we get anything back. "

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

This is set to ""new"" since it's likely people may revisit this thread over the course of the week."

It was a slightly different line than what I normally take and the conductor was so rude when I showed him my monthly pass. He asked me where I’m getting off at, I said my stop, and all he said was “no you’re not”. 

Then I realized I was on the wrong train and he said “you’re getting off at the next stop” authoritatively. 

He opens the door that was on gravel and says again “you’re getting off RIGHT HERE”, with a grin as if he’s taking pleasure in “kicking me off” the train. 

Wtf is with this behavior? I also notice this attitude with new patrons who don’t know how the ticketing system works, the conductors are incredibly fucking rude."

I am absolutely convinced that winter tires are much better than all season tires when the conditions are snowy, but a lot of the times in the winter the roads in Chicago are dry ( and cold). I was wondering if the winter tires are worse than all season tires in those conditions? My daily driving would involve the Dan Ryan but I also tend to drive long distances across the country where weather could become warmer. 

I want to be able to drive at all times and not be too restricted by Chicago weather. 

Would a good all season tire be a better choice in my case? Or a summer+winter set or all-season+winter set would be beneficial? 

I am also looking not to spend extra if I don’t need to, but again safely comes first"

There's a new thing, its called COVID and it kills. This virus kills. Want to live? Want to keep from killing thousands? Maybe killing millions?

Stay Home. Wear a Mask. Do Both. Stay home or die. Wear a mask or die. 

That might seem harsh but there is nothing about this virus that itself is not harsh. Dying gasping for breath is harsh. Watching your entire family die is harsh. Watching millions die is harsh. This virus is harsh, WE need to be just as harsh and that means we all need to say this phrase, ""THIS VIRUS KILLS"" and make sure that every action we take reflects it. Everything we do, every minute of every day needs to have the insane reality we are in at it's base. EVERYTHING.

Say this for me, say it loud, THIS VIRUS KILLS"

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

This is set to ""new"" since it's likely people may revisit this thread over the course of the week."

Probably a dumb question but I need clarification. So. I’m unfortunately living in a state where most people are morons and the state never really shut down and our COVID rates are through the roof. When I checked the airline website currently said illinois now requires a self quarantine. I’m supposed to be traveling in late August on work related business, which as of now there’s no set date on when this quarantine will end. However. My question is. 


Is this self quarantine also mandated if I drive instead? 
To rephrase because I feel like I was unclear: if flights from my location are required to self quarantine for 14 days, will it be the same if I drive instead? As well. How are they monitoring this? 


I can’t find the exact answer to this unless I just am not seeing it.

11891,1593752327,"Dear Chicagoans, this may have been posted already but I feel like this needs to be said more- If you're out dining, please be respectful to the restaurant staff, and for the love of God please tip at least 20%.",1593766727.0,"It's disheartening to hear so many of my serving friends getting gypped and getting much less than usual because patrons are not tipping as much anymore. This in turn not only affects the servers themselves but the busboys and bartender staff they have to tip out at the end of the night. This pandemic is already affecting most of their income because restaurants are operating at much lower capacities, and with mostly patio open in Chicago, there is much less turnover for tables because everyone loves to stay out in the patio for much longer than they would have indoors. They could've made double on that section, but instead, people are deciding to stay longer than two hours to sip on one drink getting some sun, when the server could've had another round of guests in that table ordering full meals.  

 Additionally, at the very least wear your mask when you're standing inches in front of the host and don't complain because you couldn't get a table. People have been making reservations in the city for long out now and they're constantly hearing people complain and trying to work around getting a table, when no space means no space. In general, just be respectful and kind to everyone who is working when you're trying to get your non-essential meal. Not every staff member is tipped and are just getting their low-wage hourly (such as the hosts and support staff.) These people are out there risking their lives so you can get your burger so be kind to everyone.  

Tldr: Tip at least 20%.Be mindful of how long you're staying- Dont stay longer than need to if you're not ordering. Make a reso, and if there's no space suck it up and don't complain.

Friends and family are uncomfortable talking about it and quickly change subject. My mental health is deteriorating (yes im seeking help). It would just be nice to talk with others going through similar experiences.

There are a lot of articles coming out recently about potential long term effects covid can have on the body but its all academic. All I know is that I thought I recovered from it with only having mild symptoms for a week, but 3 months later im still getting relapses/lingering symptoms. 

Just as a PSA - if you do know anyone who has mentioned not feeling 100% after recovering from covid, or they are concerned about lingering symptoms, please take them seriously and be empathetic.

12022,1593643247,"New study concludes that the official US COVID-19 death toll may be underestimating the true pandemic death burden by 28%, and Illinois's may be 45-60% higher",1593657647.0,"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2767980

In this study, we estimate the excess deaths due to any cause in each week of the COVID-19 pandemic across the United States. We compare these estimates of excess deaths with the reported numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 in different states and evaluate the timing of these increases in relation to testing and pandemic intensity. 

Monitoring excess deaths has been used as a method for tracking influenza mortality for more than a century. Herein, we used a similar strategy to capture COVID-19 deaths that had not been attributed specifically to the pandemic coronavirus.

**There were notable per capita increases in rates of death due to any cause in many other states, including [New Jersey, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Illinois, and Michigan](https://i.imgur.com/qf6c7bj.png), where the number of deaths greatly exceeded the expected levels.** 

The gap between the reported COVID-19 deaths and the estimated all-cause excess deaths varied among states (Table; eFigure 3 in the Supplement). For instance, California had 4046 reported deaths due to COVID-19 and 6800 (95% prediction interval, 6100-7500) excess all-cause deaths, leaving 41% of the excess deaths unattributed to COVID-19 (Table). Texas and Arizona had even wider gaps, with approximately 55% and 53% of the excess deaths unattributed to COVID-19, respectively. In contrast, there was better agreement between the reported COVID-19 deaths and the excess all-cause deaths in Minnesota, with 12% unattributed to COVID-19 (Table).

I know this is a newer amendment, but I want to know if anyone has had to deal with renting in Cook County with a criminal conviction. It talks a lot about criminal convictions within the last 3 years, but what if there is a conviction older than that? Would it still show up on these background checks for apartment applications, but it just cant (legally) be considered in approving a renter? If older than 3 years, then it seems like an Individualized Assessment wouldn't be necessary.

If anyone has any experience with this can you please share? Thanks!"

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations.

This is not only devastating to applicants who have to decide between their health and their career, this is devastating for Chicago. An event of this size will likely be a super spreading event and could threaten the integrity of the local healthcare system. 

Other states have moved the exam online or are allowing graduates to practice with diploma privilege.  States that are continuing in person (such as TX, FL, NC, MO) are not requiring masks, even as cases are rising in their states. Some states claim they are exempt from social distancing and mask requirements because they are a government agency.  

Please sign this petition as a concerned citizen if you are worried about this event. If you are a healthcare provider and willing to make a statement about the dangers of an in person event of this size, please indicate that on the form. If you are an attorney willing to help spread the word, please also indicate on the form.

June 25:
New Deaths: 18 (7 day avg 14.1)  
New Tests: 6571 (7 day avg 5411)  
New Positives: 271 (7 day avg 169)  
Positive Test Rate: 4.1% (7 day avg 3.2%)

1 Week Ago for Comparison (June 18):  
New Deaths: 17 (7 day avg 15.3)  
New Tests: 5096 (7 day avg 5122)  
New Positives: 155 (7 day avg 163.6)  
Positive Test Rate: 3.2% (7 day avg 3.2%)  

Deaths continue to slowly decline. Illinois continues to be solidly blue on the [map of where deaths are decreasing](https://covid19-projections.com/). The case metrics are relatively stable, but even maintaining a 3% positive test rate is a big improvement from 8-10% from three weeks ago.

With the good news, it's important to keep in mind that there is still quite a bit of COVID here. There is a narrative going around that COVID has moved on to the red states, but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that it's still a very big deal here.

The latest Youyang Gu projections estimate a mean of 3,614 additional Illinois deaths. That is in addition to the 6,810 that have already occurred. Illinois is the #6 state in additional projected deaths per capita (ahead of Florida and Texas). I think the governor has done a pretty solid job all things considered, but it's not time for a victory lap. Please continue to be careful out there!

They're so loud that he revs his Harley with glee while the alarms of parked cars all along our street get triggered as he passes. This thing is so loud that we can't hear ourselves talk in our apartment when he goes by, even with the windows closed. He lives a couple doors down and while I'm not averse to having a talk with him, he's definitely not the type who a conversation will change anything with - he looks like one of the guys from that South Park episode. Has anyone had success reporting something like this? We're going the route of collecting instances of the noise with video and eventually submitting all that as a noise violation but wondered if there's any more expedient approach."

Both *Bang City* and *Brick City* sets would later merge to form *600/Steve Drive/D-Block/Baldy World/Shaq City* although some still remain who claim *Brick City*, they are mostly old-heads. *Bang City* was active roughly from around 2007-2011 before it's members would stop claiming it.

12721,1593054499,So angry and frustrated with so many people suddenly not wearing masks on public transportation jn Chi. Got off a bus today and switched el cars because so people decided to just not wear masks in a huge city all of a sudden.,1593068899.0,"Buses and train cars are enclosed spaces.

This is so frustrating. A lot of people on public transportation don’t have the means to get to work in other ways. The COVID cases and death tolls are increasing as we open back up. Why are we being careless in our own city?

I watched a girl get on the bus, then see a handful of other people not wearing a mask, so she took hers off as well. 

Both of my bus drivers today did not have masks on, and I saw several other cta bus drivers driving by without one on. 

This all seems to suddenly have happened today specifically. It wasn’t like this yesterday or the day before. It is so infuriating being in healthcare and seeing this level of disregard for our city.

I was wearing my scrubs on the bus that I got off of and asked my bus driver if they didn’t have to wear masks anymore (he wasn’t wearing one either) and asked him to let me off the bus since there were five people not wearing masks on the bus (normal sized cta bus, not an extended one). 

I walk to the el and get on the el instead. Sit down away from then other 3 people on my train car. A 4th guy gets on and sits across from me with no mask on.

I was so over it at that point, and immediately stood up, frustrated that this person without a mask is less than 6 feet from me, and notice that all of the other men on my train car have their masks pulled under their chins (entirely off of their faces), essentially not wearing them anymore. I say to myself involuntarily “what is with everyone not wearing masks today” and waited at the door to get off the car. I walk over to the next car at the next stop.

So many people are not wearing masks out in public and in small spaces today.

Why are we being so careless? Why don’t we care about each other in our city? What is going on; why did this happen overnight? Why aren’t we protecting each other and ourselves? We don’t know who each other is in contact with or what each other have been doing. As someone working in healthcare, it’s so hurtful to see people blatantly ignoring theirs and each other’s wellbeing in such a simple, yet profound way. 

I’m not talking about people who can’t afford a mask or are homeless. I’m talking about everyone else, people who clearly have money, including people with a mask in their current possession that they are not using to cover their face in an enclosed, public space (eg transportation). I’m talking about cta drivers, who clearly have been wearing masks these past months already.

[Side note: I got my reusable masks — with slot for s filter — 2 for $4 ($2 each) at a store nearby, and i hand wash them with laundry soap every evening and let them dry overnight. I bring them both with me because I wear my masks ALL DAY between transportation &amp; at work, so near the end of the work day, I switch out for the clean/fresh mask.]"

12732,1593048240,Can we talk about the southside McDonald's on MLK?,1593062640.0,"I went to McDonald's for lunch yesterday and got a Filet-O-Fish combo with a bacon cheeseburger on the side. I was eating it in my vehicle in the parking lot and listening to an audiobook when I glanced up and saw the McDonald's worker I ordered from outside having a cigarette.  

She waved at me and I nodded and had to wait 7 minutes before she went back inside and I could eat in comfort again. I don't think that employees should be bothering or even trying to socialize with customers outside of the McDonald's restaurant or drive through, but that is another story.  

I went to McDonald's for dinner last night and got a McChicken combo with a bacon cheeseburger on the side. As I was driving to the second window the same girl was still working. She was acting somewhat obsequious and attempting small talk when she asked, 'why don't you eat at home instead of in the parking lot where it is hot and muggy'.  

That really bothered me for many reasons. First of all, I don't want my routine or actions to be tracked by a fast food employee. Secondly, she should not try to tell me how I should live my life. I do not want to eat at home because I find it less comfortable to be around my family and would much rather be inside my vehicle listening to an audiobook and enjoying myself and my privacy.   

Overall, I think it was very unprofessional to bring this up. I should have a clean slate with each drive through visit, not have to get the third degree because I committed some sort of faux pas. Which I don't think I did, because I often see people eating in fast food parking lots. How does she know I am not busy going to work or somewhere in a rush?  

How do you feel about eating in your vehicle in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant versus eating at home and employees commenting on it?"

A few notes: it had a Akrapovic carbon fiber exhaust pipe and a sticker on the rear left panel by the seat that says ""Twilight Gap Veteran"" with a weird alien skull. (Destiny reference, if you're curious!)

The problem is that I DESPISE driving; it overloads my senses and more or less overloads me with panic whenever I'm in even moderate traffic, and pretty much all the sunbelt states have abysmal public transportation.

I've been researching a number of different cities, but Chicago seems to tick off the most boxes, with affordable housing, culture, food, and most importantly a robust public transportation system. (The weather is a plus, too, I've always preferred the cold.)

I historically have had extremely poor luck on job searches so I'm still cautious about my prospects of being able to live here, so I have to ask, how does the job market look? I know it's a strange thing to ask with the economy as a whole more or less in freefall due to the pandemic, but what are my chances of landing a Comp Sci related job that lets me live in the city proper when I graduate? Do you have any advice on my job hunt?"

First things first, I LOVE Urban Planning and Design, and can be a major nerd when it comes to these things. Another thing I also love is this city and all the wondrous things that can be found in every nook and cranny. Which is what partially inspired me to create this thing. I lived most of my life sheltered, unable to leave my home for much, but once I entered college this year, I set about to travel the city as much as I can (Thank you U-Pass!), and memorize all the streets as I traveled so that I would be able to know the city's layout and design like the back of my hand. Of course there is Google Maps or whatever, but where's the fun in that? So, to help me endeavor, I found a nice thing to do is to label each street in coordinance with it's neighboring street streets, like take for an instance my street, a tiny little thing, Marshfield Avenue, to the East of it is Ashland Avenue, which if you take a look at any intersection, the Signs will tell you is 1600 West, and to the West of Marshfield is Paulina Street, which, if you go to the Paulina Brown Line, will tell you that Paulina is 1700 West, meaning that Marshfield Avenue is actually 1650 West, since it is between these 2. I sought to share and my discovery, by looking to figure out what the Categorical Locations for each other street in the city is, but to my shock, no such guide existed, not even from the official Municipal website, the only thing they had was a list of all the street names, more or less, which means *NOTHING* if you have no context for where these street names *are,* so I set about to do just that. Document just about the locations of every North-South and East-West Street in the City, and share it with you all to use however you wish as a Comprehensive Guide to Chicago's Streets, for the most part at least, since the city wouldn't.

&amp;#x200B;

# About the Guide

I started this guide in late November 2019 more or less, with me just wandering the streets, and documenting my every find in my notebook, and that's how it remained for a while, until February of 2020 when my college closed up shop and forced me to remain cooped up in home, where I have been for the majority of the time since. But despite being stuck inside, I was not going to let that stop my work, and so I switched to using Google Maps as my guide, it's much, much, much faster anyways. Why did I not use Google Maps from the beginning you may ask? Well, I found it more enjoying to be actually walking the streets I am cataloging for instance. Now cataloging the streets is difficult, as, since the city never posted an official guide itself, the only way for me to tell where a certain street is is by looking to see if it conveniently has a Train Station on it (this is usually never the case), looking to see if it has a signed intersection with a major street (Annoying, since typically only major streets have signed intersections), or simply in relationship with other major streets, which can be a nightmare at time, because let's just say the city doesn't always have a regular number of streets between each two major streets, sometimes adding an odd short-lived minor street in the middle because they can, a real nuisance.

Another few things to note, firstly, Dimensions. This map covers every Chicago street as north as the upper boarder of our list at Juneway Terrace (7800 North) to as south as 138th Street (13800 South), and as far east as State Line Road (4000 East) to as west as Harlem Avenue (7200 West) originally, to compensate O'Hare and the like, the west boarder was then moved to East River Road (8800 West), as it is the last major road before O'Hare Airport on the East/West front at least. Just about nearly every major road in the city is covered, 286+ Square Miles worth of Road. And yes, that means just about every road. While Originally, this Guide began with only listing the North/South and East/West Roads, my apparently copious amount of free time told me that for this thing to be complete, I also needed to include major Diagonal streets, like Archer or Milwaukee Avenue, on a separate sheet. Lastly, I also made a fourth sheet listing all the peculiar odd streets in this city that must be taken to note, as well as my own personal notes on them, like how Wacker Drive is both a North/South and East/West Street, and how Broadway and Sheridan Road can be found multiple times in the same sheet, as well as any final major roads that did not fit the strict Numbering Coordinate system the city has in place, like Lake Shore Drive.

And When I said every street, I meant it, as many Suburb or Township Streets are also listed as continuations of current Chicago Streets, because when you are in the suburbs or are driving down the road and the Street suddenly changes names, I feel you have a right to know where you are in the city, of course as I said, I cut off all Streets at my four boundaries so no new streets from the Suburbs are to be found there, even if you can go further, it's outside city limits, so it will not be found in the guide. I know it's odd to list a city as a Rectangle rather than follow its actual borders, but for the sake of fairness, and to make things a bit easier for me, it is done. Now, to take about what streets are NOT covered, mainly any streets that would prove to be a categorical nightmare for me to document, that being diagonal minor streets, common with streets that border the river, this has the unfortunate side effect of excluding entire major sections of city, such as Bridgeport where much of the streets run diagonal. It would be hard to document these streets in the current layout, as not only do they run irrelevant to the Coordinate Guide found in the city, not only are they not major diagonal streets that can be traced throughout their entire routes, but these are not found everywhere, and rather, in little tiny pockets of diagonal streets sparsed throughout the city, so that you would have to document where exactly each one is, which would be annoying. But if you all request for me to list it, I will figure out a way to do it. Another type of street that I never documented are those weird curvy suburban streets that can be found in the suburbs of the city, I elected to ignore those to save me the MAJOR hassle that dealing with them would have been, and because Suburbs are of lesser importance to this guide, I don't care for listing their streets, and only do so, because they have streets that are continuations of Chicago streets, so thus they are listed.

&amp;#x200B;

# Final Words

And with that, that is the guide. Admittedly I have may have missed a few streets. I am only one person. And if you see any that you feel should be added, write a comment, and I will gladly do so. One Final thing of note, the North/South and East/West streets are color coded with notings of Important Major Streets, and Important Minor Streets. The major streets typically follow the Chicago Mile system, and the minor streets are those streets that while still important, have no other significance. If you see any categories that should be changed, such as recategorization, adding labeling an unlabeled street, delabeling a labeled street, just give me a call. You name it, this guide is for you.  I am honestly glad for the virus, as being stuck inside has made me very bored, and to not lose my mind, I have been working on this nearly non-stop for the past several months now, who knows when I would have finished otherwise, and I feel after all this long, the guide is finally done for now, because if a sufficient enough amount of edits are made, I will post this again as a complete comprehensive version if you guys desire. I posted this now as both a way to show you my work, and to help you guys fine tune and critique my work. Because who better to know about Chicago than Chicagoans right? So yeah, share your thoughts, and I really, really hope you enjoy this. :) . Take care.

Genuine question: is the amount of violence at Jackson Red Line not something people are aware of citywide? Curious, as someone who used to live in South Loop, what perception people from other areas in the city have of that station — or Roosevelt, etc."

I live in an apartment with a wooden balcony in the back. You know the type. Do any of you grill on your balconies with a small charcoal grill? Is it a fire hazard? Do you have a grill mat or an extinguisher to keep everything kosher? Are there any ordinances I should be aware of? Should I contact my landlord maybe?

I was offered early employment with CPS and guaranteed a job, but do not know my school placement (and probably won't until July or August). I also have an opportunity in Oak Park but would need to make a decision on that before I know where I'll be in CPS. 

I am trying to weigh my options between teaching in the city and and the suburbs. CPS means I'll possibly have a shorter commute but will likely have fewer resources and have to deal with CPS bureaucracy. Teaching outside of the city in Oak Park means I'll have  a much longer commute but probably have more resources. 

When I google maps the commute to Oak Park, it says it is about 35 minutes (which isn't bad in my opinion) but I also recognize this is under Covid traffic, and normal traffic patterns could be very different - then throw in the commute during winter season. 

Does anyone have any insight into what a normal commute from LP/Lake View to Oak Park would be like, and the trade offs between teaching in CPS vs the suburbs of Oak Park?"

13889,1591757256,Don’t use Marine Ch. 16 (156.8 MHz) for radio checks &amp; other important maritime information for boaters.,1591771656.0,"If you wouldn’t use 911 to check If your phone is working, don’t use Marine Ch. 16 (156.8 MHz) for radio checks and recreational traffic.

If you wouldn’t call 911 to make sure your phone is working, don’t use Marine Ch. 16 (156.8 MHz) for radio checks.

Channel 16 VHF (156.8 MHz) is a marine VHF radio frequency designated as an international distress frequency. Primarily intended for distress, urgency and safety priority calls, the frequency may also carry routine calls used to establish communication before switching to another working channel. 

Call out to your buds on 16, but quickly chose a channel not on 16. (Channel 9 is the designated recreational boating channel) 

For radio checks you can visit VHF Channels 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 84. Simply tune your radio to the proper channel for your community.

If you purchase a boat, or own any sort of water recreational equipment please put your name, multiple phone numbers on it so If the Coast Guard finds it they can contact you to ensure that you are safe. If your boat drifts away and the CG finds it they will have to conduct hours long search’s for someone who may not be in need of assistance. This fatigues the crews from conducting actual SAR, and this can cause the loss of innocent lives. 

If your boat has an EPIRB on board or If you have a hand held one, make sure to update your contact information in the system, if it goes off the CG has to search on it. https://www.whitsundaydiscountmarine.com.au/buying/better-boating-guides/register-or-managing-your-epirb-online/

While you’re at it attach your EPIRB to your boat’s navigation systems if you have one on board, this allows the Coast Guard to pinpoint your location if it goes off and you need assistance. 

Finally teach your children that boat radios are not toys, and don’t say words like help, mayday, Coast Guard etc. unless they truly need help. And if they do need help teach them to answer the questions the Coast Guard asks as it can help get help to you quicker. The Coast Guard much rather have a kid say I was playing with the radio, then to have to search for a possible SAR case. 

Fines and or imprisonments are possible for the continued misuse of Maritime Distress frequencies. https://transition.fcc.gov/eb/Public_Notices/DA-11-970A1.html"

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

I live in the river north area, and I was stuck between bridges being up and the blockade that I knew I’d have a hard time getting back into. 

The worst part was those bells from the bridges. I can hear them at night the most, but imagine hearing those bells 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I was going to lose my mind. 

Instead of lifting the bridges and putting a permitter around the city. Let the people who want to protest peacefully do so, while also keeping an eye out for trouble makers. 

I do not agree with shutting down the entire city because of a protest. Millions of people live here. This was a controlling move that I’m absolutely not okay with.

The ComeEd bill is in my roommate’s name. I’m worried that she has not been truthful about the bill, and that she has been overcharging us. I would like some insight on what our bill should look like, as she has been evading sending photos of it. Since the fall, we have been paying $138 through budget billing. Last month, she claimed our budget billing amount increased and it is now $190. She also claims that we owe an additional $270 to pay off the amount we overused during budget billing. This seems extremely high based on what I’ve read here. The condo is a split level, we have one fridge and a mini fridge, and run the dishwasher maybe once a week. The heat or air is usually on but not an extreme temperature. My roommate leaves her lights on all the time. We all usually have our computers and TVs plugged in, and there is a large dehumidifier running 24/7 downstairs. Does it sound like this amount could be possible? Also wondering if I could possibly call ComEd for some more insight, but doubt it because my name is not on the account."

I am currently doing food delivery full time; the past few days, the mass of humanity surrounding the various outdoor destinations in Lakeview and Lincoln Park is insane. 

Masks are worn by about 10 percent of the population. Tables are jammed together. People are basically piled on top of each other, both within the restaurants and outside waiting. It’s like everyone has just completely forgotten about the pandemic. Some bars are letting people inside and serving at the bar, with zero regard for distancing. I’m looking at you, McGees. 

I’m usually not one to get hot and bothered by other people’s poor decisions, but it seems to me that if things continue to play out as they have been since Wednesday, we are in for another massive surge in Covid cases. Which will lead to another lockdown. 

Am I overreacting? 3 months was enough. I don’t want to go back to isolation from July-October. Some of these outdoor spots are legitimate super spreader events.

Would love to hear some other points of view. I know that it’s harder to spread in the outdoors, but most people are within 2 feet of each other, with no masks."

- **use a secure messaging app to organize** beforehand ([more](https://www.privacytools.io/software/real-time-communication/)) How about [Riot.im](https://Riot.im) or [Signal](https://signal.org/)? (remember to bring an extra battery)

- **prepare your cell phone, expect it will be used to track you, consider leaving your phone OFF until you need it** ([more](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protest-safely-surveillance-digital-privacy/))

- if possible, **go with a friend** or friends and watch each others backs

- **tell someone** where you are going,who you are going with and when you will be back

- **wear clothing that does not stand out** (such as black) - avoid being targeted.  also consider having a different shirt if you need to disappear targeting.(a trash bag and change of clothes is also useful to change if pepper-sprayed)

- **protect your eyes, cover your face** \- ballistic\construction eye masks (but not swimming goggles), face masks or respirators (both against pepperspray and for privacy)

- **don't wear contacts or make-up, do wear sunscreen** \- prepare to be pepper-sprayed/tear-gassed

- **bring an umbrella for concealment and cover**(also against pepper spray)

- **wear a helmet** (hoods are also good to avoid pepper spray)

- **cover up -** **protect your arms/sleeves from gas** (plastic wrap, detachable sleeves or just layered long sleeved clothing )

- **wear gloves** (dealing with barriers and tear gas canisters)

- **consider other protective equipment** (shields, forarm protection, knee pads, shin pads, hell, even chest plates if you've got it)

- **bring tissues/baby wipes** \- pepper spray is nasty, clear you throat and nose and wash it off you

- **prepare to wash out pepper spray from yourself and other peoples faces** (spray bottles with a mix of water with baking soda and bring in spray bottles, also just flushing eyes with bottled water. Milk does not work better than water.)

- **bring some first aid equipment**

- consider **ear-plugs** as protection from flash-bangs or other explosions

- **tie up your hair**, so police can't grab it

- write down **emergency contact info** and your own name on your arm or thigh

- bring something to **cut zip-ties** with like a wire-cutter

- consider bringing **a sign that is also a shield** against rubber bullets

---
**Tactics**

- **be water** - when cops start grouping up, everybody leave before things escalate,and regroup somewhere else ( this tiers cops out in their heavy gear and avoids you being boxed in,a common police tactic)

- **plan your escape route in advance and don't let yourself get trapped**(be aware that  police may surprise you from behind and try to box you in, junctions are better than alleys for this reason)

- **be prepared if you are separated from your group, have a rally point away from the protest to meet up (along your escape route)**

- **rubber bullets can blind** or worse. If they start shooting, start running.

- be on the lookout for **agitators and infiltrators** amongst you and **expel** them if found

- **disable tear gas with water bottles, cones, metal bowls** (remember to bring water!) ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/gvnsvg/portland_protestors_successfully_deploy_hong_kong/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)) ([example2](https://twitter.com/XxSn0tGirlxX/status/1265781278428676096?s=20))

- build **improvised barricades** between you and the police to stop their vehicles

- **paint or glue\glitter** thrown on windshields will blind any car, forcing it to stop.

- be aware that cops will be surveiling rioters, and that police may be out to **snatch leaders** they can identify (be aware of ""snatch squads"")

---

**Afterwards**

- consider waiting to upload photos and videos until you get home(you could even use  digital cameras instead of phones for this),and doing so from anonymous social media accounts after scrubbing metadata and hiding protester faces ([more](https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-protect-protesters-in-your-photos-and-videos-831c920d77da))([Signal now has blur faces feature](https://signal.org/blog/blur-tools))

Has anyone used EZBuy for a first time sticker purchase? Sounds like you just email them the documents and get a reference number to buy online and get the sticker mailed to you. I have heard it can take up to two weeks (and that was under normal circumstances). 

I have a private garage in my building so I won't be street parking for the time being but still want to get the sticker ASAP. Thanks!"

With the soft re-opening of the downtown area, when do you think rush hour traffic patterns will return to the point of making it quicker to take the blue line?  

And at what train stop do you think it will become impossible to find a seat on the blue line again?"

I'm from the UK and came to visit Chicago in September of 2019. I loved the city and had a great time but when I think back to my visit I always think of the kindest, friendliest, most accommodating, interesting and articulate stranger that I've had the pleasure of talking to  in a long time. 

I didn't get his name. All I know is that he was so sadly homeless and had a cat called Angela that was black and white and had a pink glittery hat on. We were stood outside the Art Institute of Chicago when we met. You picked up on my English accent and said that in England, a homeless guy famously had a cat called Bob. I was familiar with Bob and Bob's story. Angela was every bit as beautiful as Bob was. I told you that I was so glad that you had each other. 

The injustices of homelessness is something that I am sadly familiar with and, as much as I loved Chicago, the injustices were so fucking blatant and unpalatable.

Is there any way of reaching this man? Can any of you help? I don't know what I can do but as he is homeless and a black man in the US and, was, when I met him, in a vulnerable situation, I  would really really like to reach out to him. 

I wouldn't be surprised if you and Angela don't remember me, why should you? But I remember you."

14709,1591209657,"Yesterday, the Minneapolis Public School system voted unanimously to terminate their contract with the Minneapolis Police Department. Let's urge Chicago to do the same.",1591224057.0,"[https://grassrootscollaborative.salsalabs.org/policefreeschools2020/index.html](https://grassrootscollaborative.salsalabs.org/policefreeschools2020/index.html)

There's been a lot of discussion on this sub about how the city can increase accountability in the CPD and prevent bad cops from inflicting more damage on the community.

However, something I haven't seen talked about is the $33 million annual contract that CPD has with CPS.

Educators and students alike have expressed that having cops in schools does not increase safety, and hurts students (look up ""school to prison pipeline"" for more info). Research overwhelmingly shows that police in schools harm Black &amp; Brown kids and students with disabilities.

Students are calling for the city to use those funds for other resources (librarians, social workers, nurses, and mental health counselors in schools) that actually support and benefit marginalized communities in the city rather than traumatizing them.

I really urge everyone to take a look at the Police Free Schools website and use it to send an email to Lori Lightfoot, the Deputy Mayor of Education and Health,  the Chicago Public School CEO, and the Board of Education. The template is already pre-filled, all you have to do is enter your email and press send.

I know the current situation feels overwhelming, but the fact that Minneapolis has voted to take their police out of schools is huge. I really believe that we can harness the energy that everyone is experiencing right now to pressure our officials to actually make positive changes.

Disclaimer: I'm not an educator, nor did I attend CPS. If anyone is a current student or teacher and knows more ways we can help, please let me know! This is all really new to me, and the only way I found out about it was this CPS teacher's educational twitter thread: [https://twitter.com/D\_Stieber/status/1266710205754216451](https://twitter.com/D_Stieber/status/1266710205754216451)"

When my union was protesting, we did a thing called a phone zap. call and email the ""great mayor"" and his colleagues and demand change. Blow up their phones. Send emails. Demand that the mayor is charged for assault. Demand that he should be removed from office. 

All phone numbers and emails are found here on the Joliet city site - https://www.joliet.gov/government/city-council

it would be cool to call all 9, but let's at least blow up Bob O'Dekirks contacts

You could say something like ""Hi I am a resident of ___ and I am calling for the resignation of Mayor Bob O' Dekirk. The video of him assaulting a protester showcases he is unable to protect the community he swore to serve. In times of racial injustice we need a leader who is willing to engage in a dialogue with POC in his community.""

It takes thousands of people to start to make an effective protest. There are literally hundreds of times more good people than bad ones.

I'm definitely not trying to downplay how much destruction has happened, it's awful what's happening to people's lives and livelihoods. My point is just that there are so many more good people ""demonstrating"" than bad people ""demonstrating"" in the world right now.

But right after she found out the extent of the looting she told us she wanted to close the store for good. Over $100,000 in merchandise was lost, with $11,000 in damages to the store. As an immigrant minority herself, she empathizes greatly with the community in which she's been a part of. And as someone not to lay blame or to ask for help herself, I just wanted to ask for help on her behalf. Thanks for reading."

Yesterday afternoon while watching at all the news coverage of the destruction, listening to pleas for peace from politicians and community leaders, something happened.

I heard sirens. 

As you all know, lving in the city this, in itself, is not unusual. Far from it. They are a near constant. They fade into the background like the El, or traffic. Just another noise of a bustling metropolis. This was different. I noticed these. I felt these. And they scared the shit out of me.

They were the sound of fear and chaos and violence to come. 

For a breif moment, I got a glimpse of what some minorities experience all the time and it was fucking awful. I felt angry and worried but most of all? I felt powerless.

It's a feeling I will never forget. 

Stay safe, Chicago."

So I’m somewhat of a new Chicagoan, moved here in November 2018 and fell in love with all aspects of this city. The past few months have been traumatic to say the least. I lost my job from my dream organization (the one I moved here for), I ended up going back to Ohio temporarily to hunker down with my family during the pandemic, and now I’m watching from afar as the city gets ravaged by racial tensions and strife. It truly feels like things continue to get worse each month and the most horrifying thing is that no one could possibly know when this will be over. 

So I ask, how does one stay sane throughout all of this? How does one remain hopeful while being unemployed during the worst economic crisis in modern history, a global pandemic, and growing racial tensions? I’m at a lost."

They advised me to physically drive to the boundary and speak with one of the authorities on the ground. So I just did that for the last hour. 

Thing is, all I could really find were unmanned city trucks blocking roads. I couldn't find anyone to speak with.

- Broken gas main @ 800 S Western

- Lotsa shots fired all around the city 

- Dozens of fires including the Chicago Heights DMV, way to get into the party, suburbs!

The whole world *is* watching. 
We need to act to make ourselves proud, protesters and police alike. 

I cannot be home now. I can only be a Chicagoan from afar. I cry for my city that local businesses and residences were not spared. I cry that it remained so bad over the years to need such protesting and change. 

THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING

I stand with the protesters. I respect, after some thought, looting large commercial businesses. (Change my mind on any of it-I’d love some discussion.)

THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING. 

And likewise I, now from afar but in real time, watch my city on major media feeds or police scanners or any bits of live feeds from various social media. 

The whole world is indeed watching. 

We need to be good and do good, in the face of adversity. 
Stand strong my Chicagoan sisters and brothers, we *will* get through this.

Many are thinking this is over, the media is not reporting on looting happening outside of downtown but in my opinion this is about to get much worse. it is much easier to control looting in Downtown rather than spread out into all smaller neighborhoods. Given how situation is escalating even before nightfall - remember last night rioters are most likely still sleeping. The national guard will not be enough at this rate.

Check out #ChicagoScanner. Its not even 4PM at time of this post and things are already getting very dangerous.

I believe today/tonight to be much more severe than last night. Why? Its 'easier' to loot faceless big box store fronts downtown. Neighborhoods have a lot of small businesses, people will feel more strongly about those and we might see shoot outs with owners/sympathizers vs looters. Its a powder keg tonight in my oppinion.

EDIT:

The businesses are closing early and boarding up, you too if in neighborhoods around downtown take precaution. The media as of now (4:30PM) are only showing clean ups in downtown, this is false sense of security, albeit its to discourage looters by showing they would be alone most likely. Look at #ChicagoScanner, things are heating up. If you are in vulnerable position, take action. Perhaps its best to spend night elsewhere."

15549,1590944827,Opinion: Lightfoot and other mayors need to create safe protest areas immediately by doing the following,1590959227.0,"Every mayor of a large city right now should designate a large park or similar area as a safe protest area. They would need to call a fencing company to put a border around it, they should hire a sanitation company to put out Port-a-Jons, and work with police to set up a safe border around the park. I think this could be done and under a day. They then should do media blasts to tell protesters they are welcome to protest in this designated area. If people want to enter the area they have to agree to a search to prevent any weapons from entering the area. Heck, the government could even buy large posters and markers to allow citizens to create signs. This would create a safe area that can be monitored and also will allow people to get their message across. The government should have a station after each entrance checkpoint, where protesters can write down what they want they believe the government should do to change. I think this would be such a win-win, because the protist area would become sanctioned and safer. Anyone outside of the area who is doing violent acts or looting would have a higher police to offender ratio, so it would be safer (hopefully, I know that's what is the problem). I live in Chicago, and I'm thinking of Lollapalooza which has all of these things set up. I know it probably usually has a lot of planning, but I really really think the mayor could get it all organized in under a day with all this pressure. 

Does anyone else agree?"

Taking the El will still be an option on days with bad weather or when I don't feel like riding.

HOWEVER - I have seen my friends drive and how people in Chicago drive. People are glued to their phones, mopeds aren't that big, etc. and I am a little afraid of other people not seeing me / hitting me. I get you can maneuver out of it but with lane splitting being illegal I am just afraid of getting hit from behind sitting at a light or even just on a road. I would plan to go down more side streets and NEVER use the expressway or LSD, but even going down North Ave type road/ sitting at a light on North Ave makes me a tad scared.

&amp;#x200B;

So before I go grab a moped, a full face helmet, proper jacket, take a MSF class, etc. Does anyone here ride a Moped and feel safe on it? Anything I should specifically aware of? I grew up riding dirt bikes so I am familiar with motor bikes but that is on trails or tracks so no cars... never wanted a motorcycle, but a scooter / moped seems pretty practical for the city. Just afraid of other people in their giant metal boxes. I have garage parking and so does my S/O and will take proper steps locking up plus getting theft covered with insurance so that doesn't scare me too much. Only afraid of other drivers in their big metal boxes not seeing me... Any thoughts? Thanks in advance all"

I mean, yeah we can just continue buying from liquor stores, but there's certain bars and restaurants that I wouldn't mind supporting by buying some of these to-go cocktails.

Alright, so I’m 23F, and have lived in Minneapolis for the past five years, since I was 18. I moved here from an extremely rural town in IL (population 300) without knowing a soul. I completely flourished, got an art teaching degree, maintained a very consistent high end bartending job during, and managed to teach periodically throughout. I’m not sure if I want to teach, but I absolutely love the service industry while making money through art commissions.

Since I grew up on a farm 3 hours from Chicago, it was the only city I regularly visited as a teenager (I often took a bus in for day trips.) Especially compared to Minneapolis, it seems like a natural progression- although Minneapolis is wonderful. I feel like I’m craving something “more.” Chicago always had that charm, and I feel like it’s a notch up from where I’m at now. 

Is it foolish or naive to want to make this jump? Especially considering I would most likely be earning an income through restaurant work (which I’m very okay with)?

To add to everything, I’ve been in a serious relationship for about 2.5 years. I’ve always known I’d put my goals and dreams first, but I also don’t want to sacrifice something if it isn’t realistic. Looking for advice from people that have been in similar situations."

I was really proud of how considerate my fellow Chicagoans were!

I’m pretty out of shape and with how much I breathe I wear a bandana around my neck and stay at least 6 feet away from other people or pull the bandana up. Most other people seemed to be doing the same. 


Went on a 4 mile walk today and almost no one was wearing a mask or making any attempt at distancing. Went to Miko’s for Italian ice and multiple maskless runners ran by the line, huffing and puffing all over everyone. I almost got run down by a maskless bicyclist on the sidewalk. Maskless people walked down the center of the sidewalk and made no attempt to move to the edges. Multiple people were *holding* masks and didn’t put them on as they walked by.

I’m not trying to be a Karen here, but I’m a little annoyed that I’m going to have to go back to wearing my N95 in the heat because no one else is even attempting to stay apart. If you want to run or walk or bike maskless I totally get it. It’s hot; but at least attempt to not get all up in other people‘s business while you do it. Did I miss some kind of announcement that 6ft doesn't apply outside? What caused the sudden apathy?"

Around a week later on May 18th I visited the apartment again but this time it was a complete mess - [https://youtu.be/ob02UBNx-Bk](https://youtu.be/ob02UBNx-Bk). White paint was all over the floor and the carpet had been rolled away.

I moved the TV out to avoid getting more white paint on it and I didn't really do anything after that. Today I went back and was shocked at the state of the apartment - [https://youtu.be/hQDRIlGTmwc](https://youtu.be/hQDRIlGTmwc). Literally the ceiling is missing. Not only is the apartment clearly unlivable at this point, whoever was supposed to ""fix"" the leak left a huge mess with chunks of ceiling everywhere. It's a complete disaster.

There is no way I am paying $2400 a month for this apartment anymore. The lease is over in June so I will be stopping payment for the last month of the lease.

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

This is set to ""new"" since it's likely people may revisit this thread over the course of the week."

I work fast food and im 20 years old. Around late February I asked my manager to take 1-3 weeks off to care for my old father after a surgery. A little after 2 weeks I called back to tell them to put me back on schedule. They told me they would put me back on schedule after a week, but they called me back a week later to tell me that they dont have a spot for me because of the Covid crisis. I'm pretty stupid and I said I quit instead of layed off. Now I have to talk to them over the phone and have a chance of my benefits being taken away. 

My question is will IDES see my 2 weeks off as a ""mandatory quit"" and disqualify me for unemployment?"

16399,1590274795,Advice on Getting a Liquor License in Chicago,1590289195.0,"So I'm buying a restaurant during COVID (crazy, I know). It's a family run bar &amp; grill where the waiters, bartenders and cooks have all been laid off for a few months. The plan is to purchase it with some friends, rehire the staff doing delivery and curbside, then get back to business as normal when things open back up. 

My question is about the liquor license. I can see the sites about the process and eligibility but wanted to hear from people who've actually done it. From what I hear, the process is nearly impossible in Chicago and even harder with all city services shuddered. Adding relevant links in the comments.

I'm not a bot.  I'm not an astroturfer.  I'm not even in a particular rush to get my haircut or a sick new tattoo.  I would, however, really enjoy the confidence that would come with knowing that our city's leadership has a plan for how this is going to go.

I hear that open streets are ""being looked at,"" that restaurants ""aren't ready quite yet,"" that ""we're considering"" a way to open the trails.  It's May 22.  Is it unreasonable to expect  something a little more specific than what we've been getting?

I have been playing for a couple of years now, mostly Punk and Rock’n’Roll; mostly self-taught. I genuinely love playing and am a quick learner. I have my own kit at home and practice 1-2 hours 5-6 times per week.

I don’t have much coin, so ideally looking for someone $20 - $30 an hour once or twice per week.

16658,1590004238,Tons of employers who are 100% able to offer remote work will be bringing employees back into offices ASAP,1590018638.0,"I’m seeing reopening targets for white collar offices ranging from as far in the future as September, to as soon as ASAP in June, and I gotta think one of the primary determinants is just the whims and temperament of the management, some of whom are just hard ass types who don’t like tipping their hand towards the fact that they could essentially flip a switch to 100% remote work overnight with almost no opportunity cost. 

I feel like every time someone who can stay home does so, everyone benefits, even as we start to reopen and others who don’t have a choice begin to go back to work. Having thousands of workers frivolously summoned back to their offices and circulating around the city when they don’t have to seem like just throwing extra vectors for potential spread for no real reason.

To be clear, I’m not saying let’s not proceed into reopening, as we clearly need to take the first steps into it eventually. This isn’t a rant about those who need to choose between going into work or not having a job, but rather about those who can stay home and do their jobs and essentially pay no cost for it being brought back out into the world unnecessarily. It seems as though there’s this essentially open dirty secret in the American workforce that many desk jobs are 100% doable from home, and lots of businesses will be adding unnecessary risk to the whole project of mitigating the pandemic to just not admit this open secret.

What do folks think about this?"

  I believe once shelter at home order is lifted, cta would be one of the biggest vector for the virus to spread.  For the sake of public health, mask/face covering should be mandatory for cta.

I texted him to replace with equally price item and he ignored me.  I called him and he told me to calm down and would be over soon.  I live in lake view.   The restaurant was in Lincoln park.

Plagued by a community of liars, he too began to skirt the truth in order to defend himself from the fears existing throughout his upbringing.  Smoke em if you got em...This is American Spirit.

Would have liked to see the following in the doc:

Luc Longley - no starter should have been left out

Mayor Daley - he literally sat between Phil Jackson and Michael Jordan during the rally at Grant Park. If you are going to interview any politician it should have been the one in charge during all of their championships. Would have been cool to hear him discuss how the run impacted the city, what went into coordinating the rallies, etc.

Ray Clay - the Bulls announcer that did the starting lineups

Individual Season Ticket Holders that had seats for all the Championships - could have discussed what it was like to be inside the arena watching history be made, favorite stories, the excitement in the building etc.

Only 5 years later in 2013, another 100 year flood would hit after 5 inches of rain. [Here's a photo from right by Eugene Field Park](http://galleries.apps.chicagotribune.com/chi-130417-chicago-spring-flood-weather-pictures/#chi-flood18woodam-20130418) for some context. Hundreds of homes were underwater.

Enter the Foster Ave. diversion tunnel. The tech is simple: when the river reaches an action stage, it overflows into a mile long tunnel a few hundred feet below Foster Ave. You can see the inlets just northeast of Foster and Pulaski, between the river and Foster.

The overflow water then runs a mile beneath Foster until it pops out into the North Branch a little east of California and north of Foster. If you've been near the river there, you'll see the warning signs. [Here's some info on it](https://www.illinoisfloods.org/content/documents/4a_-_albany_park_stormwater_diversion_tunnel-_a_construction_management_perspective.pdf) and [here](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/albany-park-stormwater-diverson-tunnel.html).

Anyway, I'm amazed at how dry the neighborhood is right now. There's plenty to complain about with regards to Chicago infrastructure and how money gets spent, but this remarkably simple piece of tech--essentially an underground gutter--saves so much money and work in the long run.  

It's also just sort of majestic: the power of this river, just coursing beneath the city, concrete and mud and rain and pure channeled water power."

now i know the whole small claims court possibilities, but how many landlords (especially the ones with many properties and other businesses) actually go after former tenants like that?

what are the actual real repercussions other than maybe being taken to court? what are the chances you get taken to court?

I remember living in a two bedroom in Humboldt park and the bill never ever reached what it has lately and it was me and two other people.
I know at least 25$ is going to be the delivery fee and 5 or so for taxes. But I was wondering if theres some kind of trend, like areas of the city where it seems more electricity is used so maybe it cost more? Should I consider moving?

My bills range from 70 - 125 (pre pandemic). I have air conditioning and a dish washer but i unplugged and I don't use either ever since i moved in. I tried switching all my lights over to led and im still getting hit with a heafty bill. If this is something that is normal I apologize but this is my first time renting an apartment and I wonder if its something that has to do with my building or if I should ask my landlord about my meter at all. I know since im home a little more now my bill may go up but it seems crazy for me to imagine getting a bill higher than 100 per month. Does this sound normal? Id like some advice about it. I talked to my older brother and he said he once got scammed by a person who came to his house offering energy discounts and such, they did something to his meter and that his bill skyrocketed after a while. He lived near Irving Park at the time. Could something like that be the culprit, has anyone ever dealt with something like that?

Another thing is ive talked with ComEd and they werent any help, and I tried to get ahead of things by paying extra on my bill and the next billing period I all of a sudden used so much energy it ate the extra i paid from the last bill and I still had more to pay. Learned my lesson, never paying ahead again.

I was looking into the hourly pricing thing, is it worth it if I live in the city? Would it work better if i lived in the burbs or outer areas? Can I even opt in if i only live in a one bedroom apartment or if I move into a studio? Just hoping to get some comparisons from others and to hear about similar situations. Ive never rented before I just hope things are in order and if they are ill stop complaining about the bill."

An astoundingly high percentage of people I speak to have been getting hired for new jobs. Granted, these are not people in the food and beverage industry. It just really surprised me how many are actually being hired during this pandemic.

If you are a food and beverage worker who has been laid off are you looking to other industries, or are you holding out for reopening of the business at which you formally worked?

Wishing you all prosperity!"

1. It would allow people to support bars / restaurants more through takeout during the pandemic 

2. It allows people to use all of the park space during the summer ( still everyone must distance accordingly) which may also help to fight depression and anxiety 

3. Tax revenue for the city

The plan says that in order for non-essential businesses to re-open, the positivity rate of covid-19 testing has to be below 20% and according to the tracker the positivity rate in the northeast sector (Chicago) has been holding steady around 22% so far in May. (The data is a few days behind.)

When we received stay at home orders in NYC, my friend David and I started looking for meat and produce for our families so we could eat healthier meals since it was already looking like we'd be in it for the long haul. However, grocery store delivery had limited supply and a lot of meat/produce subscription box services had just started waitlisting, so we started to do farm research and found some really great farms that delivered to our doors during this pandemic.

We started to put together a database of farms that have online stores where you can get meat, produce, and dairy delivered straight to your doors or available for pick-up at the farm. We just finished adding new farms this weekend that are located in Illinois so we thought that r/chicago would love to have this resource. It is a great way to help our local farmers and help people who want to cook at home like David and myself.

So far we have around \~290 right now in our database with a large focus on IL area farms. We are still in the beginning stages and we’re doing all the research manually, so let us know if you have any suggestions, whether it’s farms to add or ideas!

Without further ado, here's the link: [https://farmsthataredelivering.com](https://farmsthataredelivering.com/)

Also, being a Chicago native, I want to say that I hope you are all safe during this time. I miss Chicago and can’t wait to visit again hopefully soon!"

17424,1589205797,Chicago Tolls,1589220197.0,"Last week, I drove from Indianapolis to Minnesota. I was advised  to avoid Chicago at almost all costs (expect nightmare traffic and tolls), but never having seen Chicago, I decided to do a drive by of  the skyline. I figured traffic would be light because of the shutdown and I was driving through late at night. I was told to expect tolls between $7-$10 each way. Avoiding Chicago would add another hour onto an already ugly drive. As expected, the drive was traffic free, and I got a decent view of the skyline.

So, as I approached Chicago, I paid 3 tolls in cash. Two through vending machines, and one to a person as I got on the skyway(?). On I90 on the other side of Chicago, I encountered 4-5  more toll plazas that were all shut down. Tolls on each ranged from $1.50-$3.00. On the return trip, I must have encountered 12-14 toll plazas that were all shut down. Each wanting a toll of $1.50-$3.00. Is this some kind of troll toll? I don't know exactly how many toll plazas I blew through, but I would guess I'm in hock to the State of Illinois $30-$40. Is this accurate?"

Just sitting there enjoying being with each other (we were fully fucking clothed and sitting in broad daylight amongst other cars. And there was *NO. SIGN* saying they were closed. ANd I don't watch fucking TV saying anything was closed. And there were other fucking cars there.

Anyway. 

This motherfucker rolls up (we had been there literally 3 minutes), walks UP to my car, OPENS THE DOOR and when *I* try to PULL IT CLOSED AGAIN SCREAMING *DUDE!! CORONA!! WHERE THE FUCK IS YOUR MASK!!!??""

He lost his MOTHERFUCKING mind and the ONLY words he could/would say from then on is ""DON'T FUCKING CALL ME DUDE!!!"" While getting EXTREMELY aggressive. 

Meanwhile my girl is freaking the FUCK out because she has literally never even had a cop interaction before and she was and STILL IS terrified that the dude got her license plate and is gonna ""retaliate"" in some way. 

Because it was THAT. FUCKED UP of a situation. 

LIke. What . The. Fuck. 

BUT..

According to Oak Lawn police department (I just caleld) The dude, in a tone of ""Fucking DUH!!!"" said ""Well YEAH we are allowed to open people's doors if they are sitting in a park parking lot. And YEAH we can scream at them. And they don't have to wear masks if they don't want to. It's up to them!!""

So. 

Just letting you know. 

This shit is happening right now. 

Sorry we sat in our car in a park parking lot. 

Won't FUCKING happen again you pieces of fucking SHIT!


EDIT: I don't think this is clear. 

*HE* WASn""T WEARING A MASK!

HE RIPPED OPEN MY DOOR!

****I***** SAID ""DUDE WHERE IS YOUR MASK?? CORONA!!!""

***HE*** SAID ""DON""T FUCKING CALL ME DUDE!!!* 

AND THAT IS **ALL HE KEPT SCREAMING FROM THEN ON!!!!**

EDIT AGAIN: Dude, I'm kinda terrified.. .Like.. No wonder you people want authoritarianism so bad..

This is beyond fucked up... I'm literally freaking out right now wondering why nobody else is worried about what just happened. 

This cop just proved he can walk up on two people in a car in a parking lot, and rip open their door and start screaming at them for 0 reasson.

And y'all will go ""Well... You shouldn't have been alive!!!"" 

Really? 

OK then. 

I'm sorry for breaking all of those laws.

We have a date of 9/19/2020 for 200 people in Aurora, IL - which is part of the Northeast region that includes Chicago regarding the Restore Illinois plan.

From reading the plan ( [https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/sfc/servlet.shepherd/document/download/069t000000BadS0AAJ?operationContext=S1](https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/sfc/servlet.shepherd/document/download/069t000000BadS0AAJ?operationContext=S1) ) it seems that large groups of 50+ people won't be allowed until a vaccine, 0 daily cases, or a treatment. Watching the press conferences yesterday they said a treatment could be something the ""decreases the spread, hospitalization, or fatalities"" associated with COVID-19. Also, the groups of 50 people outlined in phase 4 is ""subject to change"".

I wanted to get other Fall couples thoughts/reactions to this. Are you planning on postponing? Are you waiting for more information? This has to have a significant impact on not only couples, but also wedding vendors. Am I overreacting? We've reached out to our vendors and got availability from nearly all except the venue for 2021. I'm sure they're prioritizing May/June/July weddings at this point. Thanks for your input!"

17751,1588696455,"Pritzker and Lightfoot need to explain how long these quarantines are going to last, and provide clear evidence that the costs justify the benefits",1588710855.0,"

Neither Pritzker nor Lightfoot have provided any clear indication of how long these quarantines are going to last; and they have proved no clear, non-speculative evidence that the costs justify the benefits.

The models that the Illinois Health Department are using are not even considering second-order effects.

The [data](https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/hospitalization-utilization) that IDPH is relying on is considering only these factors:

1. ICU Bed Utilization
2. Hospital Resource Utilization by COVID-19
3. Ventilator Usage

They are not even considering the safety and public health consequences of joblessness, the mental health effects of isolation for this prolonged period of time, increases in suicidal ideation and behavior, child hunger increases, child abuse figures, or any other relevant data point.  Yet, it is precisely *these data* that will provide some indication as to whether the costs of these quarantine measures are justified by the benefits -- even if we take their models' predictions at face value (which we shouldn't be).

A review of the relevant [data](https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/covid19-statistics) indicates both what IDPH is both considering and not considering -- but it doesn't give any indication as to what the assumptions built into their models are, what might falsify those assumptions, or whether the assumptions themselves are even reliable in the first instance.

The [models](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-illinois-governor-projection-20200424-wd2bk4r4fbajxjsbzwcgdz2fiu-story.html) indicate that Illinois has hit its peak, and that the [curve is flattened](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/illinois).  

What that *does not mean* is that lives were saved by these measures; it just means that we have slowed infection rates.  There is good evidence that slowing the infection rate **would have saved lives**, but only to the extent that adequate medical care could not be provided to COVID-19 patients due to the medical infrastructure throughout the state being overwhelmed.

IDPH's own data clearly indicate that the medical infrastructure is [far from overwhelmed](https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/hospitalization-utilization).  It's not even being utilized at capacity, which is why the the 3000 bed [Field Hospital](https://news.wttw.com/2020/05/01/field-hospital-mccormick-place-will-close-after-treating-few-patients-curve-bends) at McCormick Place was closed after treating only 29 patients.

At the time McCormick's Field Hospital was set up, there was good evidence to justify its development.  But now?  They are so confident that it won't be needed, they've dismantled it. 

So, just exactly how many lives were saved?  

Was it 30,000?  Based on highly speculative and inaccurate estimates from biased and unreliable testing data from January and February?  Only if you take a leave of your senses. 

Pritzker needs hard data to prove that lives are being saved, and then he needs to prove that IDPH is actually considering the whole picture of what is happening in this state as a result of our response to the virus -- and he has not done that.  Lightfoot has done less than that.   Posting memes and chasing down kids playing basketball is not an effective or appropriate response to this pandemic from our mayor -- especially not when the people or our city have been forced to line up at food banks in record numbers."

I LOVE our state governor and totally support him but like if you are going to mandate something at least be practical (not everyone has the means to spend $20+ to get face masks off amazon). maybe require businesses to sell cheap face masks first then mandate people wear them.

Someone else was making a fuss about self checkout line where the clerk was wearing a mask on the chin. Talked to the person raising the issue and it was also a healthcare worker.

Apparently one of the managers also was not wearing a mask at all. I personally asked a couple employees who were filling up the products in the store to wear it on their nose and they would grunt and do it then remove it as soon as I would leave the aisle.

This is not the first time I have noticed this at Marianos'. The last time was at the one on halsted at lincoln park. This one was also downtown chicago on halsted as well but a different store.

What is wrong with people considered essential workers who do not give a %%%% about others and don t understand that the mask is not to protect them but others.

With the current employment status there are thousands of people who would rather do these jobs and do them right. We are all responsible for each other ffs.

It’s a powerful experience to all laugh or gasp or cry together, seemingly as one, but definitely not. It is so cool to feel part of a crowd in such a way, reacting to something meaningful or just plain fun.

This movie certainly was both in spades to me and that audience that day, that packed audience (I think it was seats away from sold out). This movie had excellent hype beforehand. How could it not? So many different characters with backstories and motivations coming together! Something exciting was bound to occur. How would they save the day this time? It had all come together countless times before. What would it be?

Har har. Argh. Spoilers be here, mateys.

So like I said, it was packed. Ugh let that sink in. 

The women next to me were a delight. “My man!” was a popular designation for such favorites as Thor. Spider-Man immediately became their perfect cinnamon roll. It was just one of those TIMES, going to the movies where everyone cheers! 

I remember the battle between Scarlet Witch and VISION and the baddies. Then out of the fucking shadows—!

The women next to me said, “Who’s he? Who’s he?” He hadn’t stepped out all way yet. 

The suspense was KILLING me.

Then I saw his face, and I guess as the song says, I’m a believer. I completely lost my fucking mind and screamed, “STEVE!”

Not Captain America, mind you, or even Cap, like Ant-Man. Steve. 

The entire room went bananas.

And then...the movie continued.

It was a massacre. I don’t know if there was a dry eye in the house. I didn’t dare look.

As soon as it was apparent the movie was over, not even a second later, my two favorite women in Chicago forever exclaimed, “What? What?” And then they were off, like a prom dress.

When the rest of the credits rolled, and then we all sat, muttering for ten minutes together, my daughter turned to me and asked if it could possibly be the end because movies were not supposed to end that way. She is in the lower elementary grades. 

We talked about it all the way home and a whole bunch more when we got there. At the time, I remember saying to her, sometimes you had to just wait and see what happened."

Does anyone think there truly is any risk on a concrete / metal / glass balcony to use a small campfire grill? I’m not going to light the grill closed or make any other rookie mistakes, so I feel the risk is minor and it is extremely tiny (Cuisinart Petite Tabletop). 

Otherwise I would have to buy an electric grill and unfortunately the equally nice ones run close to $300+ after covers etc. 

Just curious if anyone else does this and if they believe there truly is any increased risk of using 1lb propane tanks on a gas grill versus an electric grill. Wouldn’t be refilling tanks either, would dispose of each time.

17886,1588493782,The lockdown will be lifted and here is why.,1588508182.0,"The government does not have the constitutional right to force people in their homes.  Sooner or later, the government will have no option but to let people exercise their freedom. The lockdown will be lifted and you'll be able to pursue whatever makes you happy again.

*There is a catch to this though:*

**Your healthcare will likely be denied if you get sick.**  If not denied, you'll be slapped with a bill that includes an estimation of damages made from spreading the virus.  For example, if you go clubbing, catch the virus and spread it to a doctor getting food at the market, you'll likely be held accountable for the cost of his or her healthcare, if they die, their death and the financial contribution they provided to society from whatever profession they did.  How much money does the hospital lose trying to find a new doctor equally qualified?  The patients that pass away because of one less doctor. Etc.  Bottom line, your healthcare is *not a constitutional right*.  If you've elected to exercise freedom from the lockdown, the government and state may be obligated to then deny you healthcare.  So if you're going to protest this lockdown, try and make healthcare a constitutional right. That and various other supportive programs *not outlined as a constitutional right.*  Like the stimulus paycheck, unemployment benefits, mortgage relief, etc.

So don't expect much help from hospitals, the public or the government if you get sick from whatever it is you think you're missing out on.

If you're wondering why, here is why:  

There is no incentive for the public or the government to assist people unwilling to cooperate in preventing the spread of the illness.  Surely, you can have your right to do as you please, but denying healthcare is a rational response to the virus given its effect on our financial system and society as a whole.  Plus, is it really fair to the public and those tirelessly working at hospitals to support you after catching the virus and disregarding the lockdown?  How would you feel if it was the other way around?

If you want to be free, the government won't stop you.  Be free.  Just remember that you are now free of it's services too.  All the government is asking you to do is hangout inside for a little bit until a vaccine is created.  If for whatever reason you can't do that, than expect to be completely responsible for yourself--including your healthcare and other services used during this economic hardship.  This may include dependants as well.  Even though they may be following lockdown rules. Not only will the government not support you, but neither will taxpayers.  Your interpretation of freedom actively threatens the pursuit of happiness of those around you, even if we're all in lockdown.  Not just that, but the fabric of society.  New York is a prime example of what could happen if lockdown went away.  They have every legal right to do this and their obligation is with protecting those not contributing the spread of the virus, not those contributing.

Thing is, if you get sick and are denied, what are you going to do?  Are you going to protest your ""freedom"" for healthcare as a constitutional right now?  Do you really think people following the lockdown and not getting sick will support you?  I sure as hell won't.  If you catch the virus and are denied healthcare because you couldn't follow the lockdown, you won't get a dime from me as a taxpayer.

The irony of doing this is the insane amount of freedom you sacrifice for one that you think is being taken away.  I fail to understand why anyone thinks their freedom is being taken away?  Do you honestly think society will return back normal if this lockdown was lifted?  Just because you may not be sick or experiencing the effects of the virus, doesn't mean it isn't happening.  If the government refused to act and acted as how some here think we should, you wouldn't even have any rights anymore.  Society would completely collapse.

Something to think about:

*What a government doesn't do is equally important to what it does do.*"

The attitude of this sub has changed a lot in the last few weeks. You all have a right to be angry. This sucks for a lot of people. I've already had two shows cancelled, my prom, graduation, and more. Today marks the 42nd day that I've been mostly at home, not really leaving for much other than a bike ride. But it seems like a lot of people have forgotten why we're here or what the end goal is.

We don't a lot about the virus. Some states have started seriously opening their economies this past week. We don't know how that's gonna go. Maybe there will be a spike in symptomatic/ confirmed cases in the next few weeks, but I really hope that's wrong and we can all get on our way to opening. But these states are even ignoring even the *president's* guidelines on reopening the economy (14 continuous days of declining cases). I wish for this to be over soon. But right now we're buying time. We don't have anything close enough to a good plan for how to reopen. Stick in this guys. Stay strong.

I’ve heard that the main lot is closed by the staircase but that other lots are open. Are they still open? Are there a bunch of Trump/MAGA people there right now?  I’d like to visit but also practice social distancing and avoid the main trails where the crowds would be.

 ""Gazebos up to 150 square feet in area (open air with roof and no walls) that comply with all zoning and construction type setback requirements and are not less than 2 feet from all property lines and not less than 6 feet from all residential buildings.  (Combustible gazebos must be at least 3 feet from property lines.)""

Not sure if I am going to get an out of the box one or build it, whatever ends up being safer, but does this cover me freely adding a pergola? The one I'm thinking about might be slightly over 150sq ft. If so, I went through the permit flowchart and I think that permit would be $500. Can anyone confirm?"

I was thinking of renting a room for start but all sites that I looked at don't seem very trustworthy. I checked craigslist, [roommates.com](https://roomates.com/), [easyroommate.com](https://easyroomate.com/), [trulia.com](https://trulia.com/) (looks very shady...). Also I have very few friends here and they are all pretty much all settled so I can't count on them to share apartment. All suggestions are more than welcome.

Also do you think that I could find something for 600-700 $ in Mount Prospect, Arlington Heights, Des Plains (I'll be working in this area)?"

2. Reopening of some state parks and golf courses. People will be allowed to fish and boat in state parks so long as no more than two people are in a boat.
3. Greenhouses, garden centers and plant nurseries were always supposed to be considered essential businesses, but the new order emphasized they can open.
4. Animal grooming services can reopen.
5. Retail stores can partially reopen. Employees will be able to fulfill phone and online orders, and customers can get those orders through outside pickup or delivery.
6. Surgical centers and hospitals will be allowed to perform elective surgeries, but will need to make sure that patients are not ill with Covid-19.

18266,1588110230,Emissions Testing,1588124630.0,"As it turns out, one of my cars has been due for an emissions test before my plates need to be renewed. They expire EOM. This normally isn't an issue but I don't drive the car unless conditions are ideal so I put it off. Emissions testing sites are closed through 4/30. 

The notice on the IL Air team website says

&gt;**The Secretary of State’s Office (SOS) has extended vehicle registration expiration dates to at least 90 days after SOS Drivers Services facilities reopen, allowing motorists to wait to have their vehicles tested and renew vehicle registrations.**

So does that mean I can drive my car after the expiration my plate sticker? Not that I plan to drive it but if the need arises, or if the testing sites reopen on 5/1 but I can't make it to get the car tested until some time after that I just want to make sure I'm not getting an expensive ticket or something."

I hear so many gripes about being under the equivalent of ""light touch house arrest."" Imagine having to wear an anklet that reveals your position at all times and not being able to leave your 400 square foot apartment for a year. Now imagine being locked in a 9x6 foot cell, 23 hours a day, with and having to see your cellmate take a shit every day on a seat fixed to the podium of the same sink you both use to brush your teeth.
* If you have a job and you want to get outside but the joggers are fucking you up, why not spend $30 at Jewel and make a bunch of sandwiches for the homeless? Put on a mask and some gloves and pass out some food to people that have it much harder than you do.
* All you joggers who (1) can't manage to run on the right side of the road, (2) see no reason to wear a mask while running, and (3) SPIT ON THE PAVEMENT WHILST RUNNING, open up that pocketbook of privilege and get your entitled ass a treadmill. I see plenty of runners doing things right. But I see way too many of them doing everything wrong.
* Lakeview residents are going to buy us all at least another 2-4 weeks of lockdown thanks to their infuriating carelessness. Every neighborhood in this town has examples of people who feel themselves the exception to our new social contract. But Lakeview has, time and again, proven itself to have those kinds of assholes in spades. Mothers out with their infants in unprotected strollers walking shoulder-to-shoulder with Stacy and Karen—none of them wearing masks. Finance bros fresh off their clandestine jerk sessions on Zoom taking to the streets without either mask or shirt to pound pavement and outrun that fat little boy they left behind in Ohio. And, of course, the gay youth, too fresh to remember the epidemic that stole from their culture an entire generation of elders that could be admonishing them now for not behaving better. (Before you come for me on this, I am a gay man myself.)
*  But I see a ton of us are doing the right thing, and Chicago is succeeding in staving off what was, just a few weeks ago, a Biblical cataclysm. I want to get outside too. God knows I miss my friends dearly. And I'm no fan of this dad bod I'm quickly acquiring in lieu of the gym. But, all things considered, it isn't THAT bad......yet. We just have to keep it up a little longer.

I understand that choosing between bad options in the interest of public health to limit the damage of a viral outbreak is not an easy decision and I don’t envy their positions.  

But in this little sociological experiment, the city is reaching it’s tolerance threshold.  Has anyone driven by Lincoln Park today?  Or Oz Park, or any other public open space?  They’re mobbed.  Shoulder to shoulder with people jogging, walking dogs, having a picnic, rollerblading, etc.  

Cities don’t work with people stuck inside.  They aren’t designed to have people stuck inside, and people won’t comply with being stuck inside.  You’ve got almost 3MM people who sacrificed personal space and comfort for the benefits of a city - all of which require one to leave their apartment.  

I honestly don’t know what the strategy should be at this point, but I think it’s becoming abundantly clear that as the weather warms and time under quarantine drags on, its naive to carry on as if just extending closure orders is solving any problems.  We are doing double damage now.  Punishing businesses and driving people insane, all basically for naught if the whole damn city is rollerblading and jogging on crowded sidewalks.  

I really do believe the city better start considering plans to let businesses open at reduced capacity or something.  Otherwise within a few weeks you’re going to have larger, more concentrated groups outside instead of dispersed groups inside."

I'm a native Chicagoan currently living in NYC. I just started a new job with a Chicago-based firm, which has gotten me to start thinking about moving back. Being stuck in a small NYC apartment for two months due to this slow-rolling disaster is also playing a role, truth be told... But that's a topic for another time.

I'm trying to get a sense of the lifestyle I could have if I moved back, and one of my main questions is whether it would make more sense to rent or buy an apartment. From what I've been able to ascertain from online research and talking with family/friends, the real estate market had barely recovered from the 2008-09 collapse even before covid, right? I assume the current situation won't help prices in Chicago or elsewhere.

I'd love to hear people's thoughts on whether buying makes sense. My plans are very preliminary, but I'm exploring 2-bedrooms on the North Side, preferably Lakeview or Andersonville, maybe Edgewater.

Thanks for any advice you might have. And stay safe!"

Forgive me if this sounds like a silly question or disrespectful considering current events, but I wanted to ask you guys on this subreddit your thoughts on your city.

I plan on moving out of my parents’ house and out of NYC in the next 2-3 years hopefully. Chicago is a potential city I want to move to because I’ve heard it’s a hub spot for the industry I work in (logistics). Also, I would like to rely on public transportation because my car is currently totaled.

The thing is, I would like to rent on my own if possible and I’m wondering if this is too far fetched of a goal in mind?

I have plenty saved up from working (around $23K). I don’t mind being in a small or boring area because I’m more so introverted, so I’m not looking for an exciting lifestyle.

How much would I have to make to be able to rent on my own?"

That said there could be a common sense middleground between shutting down society, ruining the economy, ruining lives, and giving zero fucks and going completely back to normal. Maybe we keep concerts and large venues closed, we wear masks in public and limit occupancy in businesses, but we get back to life.

At this point the goal posts keep changing, first it's we don't want to overwhelm the hospitals, now we want to see ""no new cases"" which is unrealistic.

Another month accomplishes nothing, the virus will still be here, it's not going anywhere. I hear some calling for not going back to normal until we have a vaccine which at the soonest ""might"" be september, more than likely a year to 18 months and it could never happen. Personally I'd rather take my risks with the Rona than be the first to take a vaccine that was rushed out.

I'm calling for civil disobedience. Sure exercise some common sense, keep your distance, I'd even cave to wearing a mask despite thinking they aren't that affective and actually cause people to touch their face 100x as much as without one, but I'd even be up for that.

I'm calling for others who agree to open their businesses, get together with friends and family, go to parks. They can't stop us all, there's power in numbers. 

Those who are terrified are more than welcome to stay at home and those who are in an at risk group should probably stay at home as well. The rest of us can get back to work, open our businesses, and support those who can't come out. If you're house had termites would you burn down the house or take a more surgical approach and target the problem area? Staying shut down is burning down the house.

If anyone decides to open back up I'll be the first to frequent your busienss and help support you and your business.

The park space should still be closed to *groups* or gatherings like picnics, super-chill yuppie dog owner hangouts, drum circles, etc. The section of the Lake Shore trail between the Chicago River on the south end, and North Ave Beach on the north end should remain closed because it's too narrow. 

If a limited number of cops enforced the rules through actual ticketing, I think people would follow it. The city could also ban all parking on Stockton drive to discourage people from driving to the park, but that might create equitable access issues. 

The Lake Shore Trail is much more spacious than sidewalks and inland parks, and if people are continually moving, with a face-covering, the risk of exposure would be low."

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

18865,1587332530,Chicago Cost of Living Budget,1587346930.0,"I  am going to graduate with an M.S. later this year and move to Chicago  for an entry-level job. The base salary is 77k. I used a calculator to  get my net income after tax, and it came out to a monthly net income of  $4,200. I have approximately 60k in graduate loans, with an interest  rate of \~8%. The calculator took into account all taxes, insurance, 401k  contribution of 6%, and additionally a monthly transportation fee of  $100 per month (I can use pretax dollars to pay transportation fees).

I've  never made a budget before, so I want to know if my budgeting is  realistic and reasonable. From googling around, these are the numbers I  came up with:

20% Savings, $840

Student Loans, $600

Groceries/Eating out, $500

Personal Items/House supplies, $50

Fun, $150

Subscriptions (Only Netflix and Spotify), $20

Internet, $60

Renter's Insurance (I don't know what this is, I just stumbled upon it in every budget), $30

The  total above is $2,250, and the remainder left is $1,950. I want to use  this remainder for rent and utilities. This is well-above the general  rule of thumb of 30% net income for rent with utilities included, which  for me is $1,300. However, my situation is that I would like to rent a  decent 1BR place because after 5 months of living alone, my girlfriend  would also graduate and move in with me. My worry is that I have to  sustain the initial 5 months of rent and utilities alone, and want to  know if its even possible with my circumstances? Should I cut a bit into  my savings % per month and allocate it elsewhere? What other budget  items did I not include? Are my estimates conservative? I also want to  know how bad this plan is financially, or if it's not completely dumb  and irresponsible? Should I just scrap this plan, and decide on living  somewhere with far less rent/utilities?

I  know that I am putting too little off my student loans, but my plan was  to keep it up for the 5 months, then change my payment plan to pay it  off a bit more aggressive than how I have it now. If my hypothetical  rent/utilities is true of $1,950, I would split that with my girlfriend  later and it would then be well under the 30% rule of thumb.  My  girlfriend is to make around the same as me after she graduates. Also, I  would agree that spending nearly $2,000 is ridiculous, and that as a  new-grad, I don't have that sort of luxury to live like that. It is just  a personal desire that my girlfriend and I share. We prefer not to live  in a very small apartment. We were looking into more of the modern  apartments, and nothing of ridiculous commute. It doesn't have to be  downtown, it can be a 30 minute commute away.

Additional  info: I don't smoke, and I only drink occasionally with friends.  However, I don't think I will do that quite often anymore since it's not  university."

Ladies, how safe is it ACTUALLY there?",1587201234.0,"I experienced some street violence in Albany, NY and I wound up moving to Oregon as a result. My boyfriend's mom lives in Chicago and just rented a beautiful house there. We'd have an entire floor to ourselves, automatic managerial positions (she's the hiring manager), and I'd be a bit closer to my family back in NY. The house doesn't appear to be smack in the middle of an urban area, but I believe the job would be. I may have flexibility on which of the 5 Chicago locations I'd work in, but it would be in the nightlife industry doing communications-based work.

But I'm really worried about the environment. It's peaceful here, even downtown. What are my chances, realistically of hearing gunshots outside our window in Chicago? How about walking alone during the day - how safe is that for a smaller-framed woman? Does the crime depend on who you know as opposed to being random? Does all of this depend on the neighborhood (and if so, which areas are the safest or least safe?) Where I moved from, the crime was random - I stayed out of trouble and still someone try to someone kill me in broad daylight.

When I say ""safe,"" I mean things like catcalling, stalking, hearing gunshots, random acts of violence. I don't care if an area is wealthy, low income, or what the makeup of the population is. I legitimately only mean safety being a woman. What do YOU experience in Chicago?

If it's not a good fit for me, I'm not moving. Leaving my boyfriend and housing stability would be just as big of a decision as moving, though, so I need to know how it really is. I know stats can be misleading."

What are we actually accomplishing by extending the lockdown? Hospitals were not even close to capacity even at our peak.

I think it's human nature to want to help as much as we can to stop this virus and we always strive to do anything we can to mitigate the damage. Unfortunately people have to understand that at this time there's really nothing we can do. Staying inside would only save lives if the hospitals were overcrowded which they are not and won't be considering we are past the peak. The only thing this lockdown really accomplished is slowing the spread and delaying some inevitable deaths by a few weeks. A vaccine is at least a year away and may never come at all. Herd immunity will likely come first.

Risks are all around us everyday, wether it's driving down the highway, getting the flu, obesity, etc. We could shut down all highways and it would be a guarantee that   accident deaths would decrease, but we don't. We could shut the city down every flu season and I guarantee that would also save lives. We have to look at this from all angles. Let people choose their own amount of risk. Closing small businesses and depriving people of their paychecks is just making this problem worse. 

Feel free to change my view on this matter."

You can break down into individual counties. I see some people starting to claim that this thing is going to have a &lt;1% death rate which is just irresponsibly untrue and not reflected in any data thus far. Not only that but I've never seen statistics deviate that far from the mean without external influences (a miracle drug, vaccine, etc).  So here are some current confirmed statistics.

Here is the Chicago area thus far:

Illinois as a whole:

20,852 confirmed cases

720 deaths

3.45% fatality rate

[Cook County](https://bao.arcgis.com/covid-19/jhu/county/17031.html):

14,585 confirmed cases

485 deaths

3.33% fatality rate

[Lake County](https://bao.arcgis.com/covid-19/jhu/county/17097.html)

1,445 confirmed cases

42 deaths

2.91% fatality rate

[DuPage County](https://bao.arcgis.com/covid-19/jhu/county/17043.html)

5.71% fatality rate


[McHenry County](https://bao.arcgis.com/covid-19/jhu/county/17111.html)

235 confirmed cases

6 deaths

2.55% fatality rate

[Kankakee County](https://bao.arcgis.com/covid-19/jhu/county/17091.html)

204 confirmed cases

9 deaths

4.41% fatality rate

[Lake County, IN](https://bao.arcgis.com/covid-19/jhu/county/18089.html)

744 confirmed cases

25 deaths

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

This is set to ""new"" since it's likely people may revisit this thread over the course of the week."

I feel like I’ve only seen crime reports and I’m freaking myself out about the safety of living and traveling in the city. Realistically, how bad/frequent is it? Since I know it affects crime rates to a certain extent - I am female. 
I’ve lived in the Chicago suburbs my entire life, and have visited quite a few times, so I’m not completely clueless as to how things work (be aware, don’t hold things out that are easy to grab, hold purses tightly and towards the front, etc.) but I’m curious how it seems from a less touristy point of view and more from a local point of view.

[“The curve is still upward trajectory. Just because we’re bending the curve does not mean it’s bending down yet,” Pritzker said. “People need to understand that it is unlikely that we will be able to lift this stay at home before April 30. And, indeed, as we approach April 30 we will be thinking about, ‘What are the restrictions or rules that we need to set going forward after April 30?'”](https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/04/09/we-are-in-fact-bending-the-curve-gov-pritzker-says-but-death-toll-still-rises-by-66/)

I know anything can change, but that sounds like there is currently some confidence that it will not be extended further, right?

I'm sure it will be a slow roll-out, maybe with gatherings of 2 to 10 to 50 over time, but I'm hopeful we will be allowed some offline socializing in the not-too-distant future."

A CDI is a Certified Deaf Interpreter. CDIs are specialists in American Sign Language. They are used when there is a language barrier between the ASL Interpreter and the Deaf person, but not necessarily ASL as a second language. 

In this situation, a CDI stands on the podium and is given a ""feed"" from an ASL Interpreter, who is sitting in the front row, interpreting what is being said to the CDI, who then interprets into ASL. This provides a higher quality interpretation into ASL. 

For any D/deaf persons who wish for an English translation, they can use captions.

My question is what is the store policy for this?  Are the stores issuing mask and gloves to their employees? Requiring them to be worn?

I can't do much but if a grocery store is giving its workers mask and gloves and the others aren't I'd give my money to the other store."

Due to an error on my part I should not have filed the claim. However it's now impossible to talk to anyone at IDES, since every time you call you have to sit through almost 4min of the automated system talking before you're able to push a number to make a choice, and right after you make a choice it just says ""we're unable to take your call at this time"" and then it hangs up. There is literally no way to talk to a human, I've been calling for 6 days.

The contact form on their website is also a dead link. I emailed the general contact email of the Lt. Gov. office and tweeted at the IDES Twitter account (even though, looking at their timeline, they don't interact with anyone, just post their own stuff), but that's all I can find to do. I don't want to get in trouble for having a claim open when I shouldn't have one, so any ideas?"

20136,1585967155,Help for a friend who got accepted to the university of Chicago's graduate program to study philosophy!,1585981555.0,"One of my closest friends was accepted into the graduate program to study philosophy. Despite the grant the school offered him, and his financial aid, he is still $10,000 dollars short. It's probably a long shot, but I was wondering if anyone knew an alumni that could help him out (send an email/grease some palms) or maybe could recommend any potential resources or grants he may of over looked? 

My friend has worked very hard to earn his education. When I first met him at UNC Charlotte he was living in his car with his mother, and after they eventually moved into an Extended Stay he ended up tearing his ACL. Despite all that he still came to class every single day in his wheelchair and got all A's.   


His dream is to eventually become a professor teaching animal ethics. If he receives a masters degree from Chicago it would open up so many doors for him and change his life forever.

Any help would be greatly appreciated."

I don't know if Jared Kushner knows this, but it's called '**The United States** of America' - and the federal government, which has a stockpile, is supposed to be backstopping the states.  He apparently does not know that.  Now, at the same level, we have stockpiles - at the city level, we have stockpiles.  And, we're using them now.  I don't think anybody expected a respiratory pandemic that would deplete all of the respiratory stockpiles that exist - and that the federal government would **abdicate** its role, and have 50 states and 5 territories on top of that all competing with one another, and competing against the federal government to get the PPE that's necessary.  So, I think Jared Kushner just does not understand this issue.  He does not understand what the federal government's role is supposed to be in a **national emergency**.""

**LL:**  ""And if I can just add - um, and I think the governor just showed incredible restraint under the circumstances - he is 100% right. We shouldn't have to **beg** the federal government to step up and assume its responsibility here. When we hear from the head of the CDC that the **federal stockpile** only has **10,000 ventilators**, the question we should ask is, **'What the heck has the Trump administration been doing over the last three and a half years?'** What that tells me, and I think what that tells public health professionals across the nation, is that the federal government has failed to do the planning that it needs on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis to be **prepared.** So, we're not waiting for the feds. We're doing what is necessary.  The governor and his team have been working tirelessly to source the materials that we need to bring to Illinois.  **But - my-oh-my - somebody like Jared Kushner casting aspersions on the hard work of governors across this country who have been working tirelessly - night and day - to be leaders, and to care for their residents and their states: that tells you a lot about the character of him.**"""

Option 1: The Hawks get 6 championships in a row, starting at 2010, they win through to 2016, but at the cost of taking away one of the Bulls’ 90’s 3-peats. 

Option 2: The Bulls get those bullshit two Jordan-less years that should have been championships, making that an 8-peat, but you have to take away all the Hawks titles this past decade. 

Option 3: Bears get 3 Super Bowl wins in a row, from this upcoming season for the next three seasons, but you have to give up all the Bulls and Hawks championships.

I called 911 in case he decides to hit a person but just a heads up. He had sunglasses, dark shorts, a gray sweater and hat with a Pom Pom on the top."

Since the mods deleted my previous post due to it being an image of the cat as the post, I have to create another one.

I was walking to my apartment and noticed a cat sitting in a yard on the 4700 block of North Springfield. I knelt down and he came to me which is when I was able to pet him a little. I noticed he started to itch his back a lot on the concrete which is when I realized two open-wounds on his back/neck area. I picked him up but he started to become very resistant which is when he clawed me a few times and squirmed out of my arms before sprinting across the street.

I feel terrible I was unable to take him to a nearby vet to get evaluated/checked out which is why I am posting here in case if anybody lives in that vicinity/Albany Park area to look for this poor baby."

If you keep the butt ends of romaine/lettuce/green onions, they can be regrown fully in as little as 1-2 weeks. 
2. Make your own bread. Get a sourdough starter and bake your own bread. You only need water and flour to feed the starter and keep it going. 
3. If you have a Costco membership, get a huge bag of rice, which can be used for countless meals. Soups, sides, tacos, bowls, you name it. 
4. If you have an Instant Pot, it makes great yogurt, apple sauce, soups, or chicken stock. All will be cheaper than buying in the stores. Soups are easy, cheap, and are great options to freeze and store for later, Instant Pot or not. Stocks are easily made from bones or vegetables and water.
5. Make your own salad dressings. All you need is an oil and vinegar as the base, and you can create many differently flavored dressings that will cost way less than store-bought. 
6. Make your own granola. Again, the base ingredient you need is rolled oats, and from there things like peanut butter, chocolate chips, coconut oil, etc. to make it."

I live in Sweden and we have an assignment on English speaking places and I have chosen to talk about the city of Chicago. It would be great to hear from some people actually living in Chicago! 

How is the living condition in this place (shelter, food)? How does an average citizen live?

What are the values and people's attitudes toward life, children, health care et.c?

What places of interest are there (buildings, museums, schools etc.)?

Does Chicago have any specific traditions, holidays or festivals?

What is the music scene like? Is there a lot of underground bands?

As a result of “lower than normal patient  volumes” due to COVID-19, DuPage Medical has implemented a reduced work  schedule policy, under which employees will take unpaid time away from  work or use “accrued and available vacation time,” the memo says.

""While we have redeployed some of our  employees to support different departments and/or roles as applicable,  we’re in the unfortunate and unexpected position of having to reduce  work hours for our employees to better align with the reduced patient  volumes we are currently facing,"" DuPage Medical spokeswoman Marianne  Geiger said in an emailed statement.

Check out our full event calendar [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/skip-the-small-talk-10841599652) and grab your tickets! Hope to have you there!

\------------------

In case you haven't seen these posts yet, I host these events called Skip the Small Talks where I put strangers in a room and get them talking to each other about more meaningful and interesting stuff than social norms generally allow. My background is in social and clinical psychology research, so my approach is informed by the literature on self-disclosure, question-asking, game theory, and some other stuff that I can nerd out about in person if you end up coming to the event and are interested in hearing me ramble for a while. But basically, we use cards with questions written on them and a lot of structure to allow people to open up to strangers more comfortably and quickly than you might usually.

People have reported finding Skip the Small Talks useful for meeting new people, for becoming more comfortable in social situations outside of Skip the Small Talk, and for interacting with humans in a low-effort context. Some Redditors said some nice stuff about us [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonSocialClub/comments/b0146n/experience_with_skip_the_small_talk/) if you want to check out other people's take on it.

You can check out all our events [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/skip-the-small-talk-10841599652) and you if you want to keep up with our events, you can sign up for our e-mail list [here](https://www.skipthesmalltalk.org/) (I don't spam, I don't share your e-mail address with anyone, and I really genuinely do hope you'll let me know if the e-mails ever start getting annoying).

If you do end up going and if you're feeling up for it, come say hi to me and let me know what you thought!"

Now that its been a week or two, are things getting better or worse? I know some theorized (myself included) that there really wasn't much panic buying going on. Just that everyone was doing 2 weeks worth of shopping to prepare all at once. And others thought that the panic buying was rampant.

Target's stock has improved quite a bit. Hand soaps are now 95% fully stocked and the shelves are full. Meats are now 80% full of stock where 2 weeks ago they were completely empty. Canned goods are roughly 85% restocked where they were completely 100% wiped out. Things like refrigerated pasta, frozen foods, etc are all back in stock.

Everything is pretty much close to normal except a few items. Toilet Paper was still all gone. Acetaminophen is 100% out of stock. Dry pasta was still gone. And [isopropyl alcohol completely out](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2). Those were the only things I noticed that couldn't be bought in any quantity from any brand.

I also noticed that Target was almost completely void of customers at 6pm on a Sunday. In the self checkout there was an employee that just sat there and waited for someone to leave their station and it was immediately wiped down. Employees had gloves and masks on.

All things considered, if they're keeping all flavors of Jeni's Ice Cream in stock, I don't think we're going to starve to death anytime soon. And I think that'll be close to the end of panic buying.

So if you want to save you and your family, you should repost this article &amp; share it to your friends and the public. Where is the freedom of speech in America USA, is that real of fake ?! Wake up the people !

**The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

He's 11 and goes to a reduced-fee after school care program while my mom works. But now my mom's temporary unemployed due to the coronavirus.

My little brother currently stays at home. My mom's worried that once the pandemic ends and she goes back to work, there will be no one to take care of my little brother bc they're no longer eligible(bc she would have filed for unemployment this year)

In normal circumstances, if you're unemployed, you're ineligible for CCAP. But this circumstance is different. Will applying for unemployment right now make her ineligible?

Is it cheaper? Is it “better quality”? I’m curious as to what people have to say?

Anecdotally I’ve mentioned I’ve had a dog and someone mentioned in my office that I’ll never find a good yard and need to move to the suburbs.

Anyway, I’ll leave it up to you.

Sweet, cuddly, chubby and vocal, you will fall in love with her when you see her. She needs two things daily beside food: water and wheat grass. The grass will her oral and dental health in excellent condition. The food, 2 packs of Pretty Please will come with her. Also, a supplement for joint health “TDC” (30 pills left). I cut the tip of the pill and squeeze it on my finger, Money’d lick it. (The feeding time for this is around 5 AM). Drinkwell fountain water and Aquaphoric self watering planter (7”), will also included.

Please DM me and I’ll give my phone number and Money’s pix.

1) We need PPE! The lack of Personal Protective Equipment (i.e. N95 Surgical Masks, face shields, gowns, gloves etc) is quite literally killing healthcare workers. If you or your business has PPE or has the capacity to produce PPE, feel free to reach out to me or provide your information in order to make a donation on this website: [https://sites.google.com/view/getmeppechi/for-donors?authuser=0](https://sites.google.com/view/getmeppechi/for-donors?authuser=0)  
2) We need blood! Hospitals and blood blanks are facing an impending blood shortage so one of the most tangible ways you can support is by donating blood. You can find your closest bloodbank at any of the following links  
\-[http://www.aabb.org/tm/donation/Pages/Blood-Bank-Locator.aspx](http://www.aabb.org/tm/donation/Pages/Blood-Bank-Locator.aspx)

\-[https://www.redcross.org/give-blood.html](https://www.redcross.org/give-blood.html)  
3) We need support! Whether in the form of donating money to the PPE GoFundMe so we can purchase more PPE or calling your US Reps and Senators and asking them to support the Frontline Health Care Worker's Assistance Act, we need more voices and support in this effort.  


Thank you so much for reading, please feel free to PM me if you have any questions or other ways to help."

20947,1585263529,PSA for those using IDES to get unemployment,1585277929.0,"Be tenacious with this complete and total piece of shit system or you will lose your benefits.

The system is \[b\]garbage\[/b\].  I was laid off at the end of last year and claimed unemployment.  The system is set up where you certify benefits weekly but have a window for only 2 working days a week.  Not sure if it's by design, but my window reported errors every other week.  So I effectively had 2 8 hour windows twice a month. Any time you do something not by the book, you get a generic ""you can't do this now"" error.   So in my case, if I missed one of those windows, I'd lose benefits -- which is what I did.  Every subsequent trip told me ""you can't do this now"" which of course raised no alarms as I had seen it so much.  

After getting the error for several weeks in a row I thought nothing of it as I was living off of the remainder of my severance so didn't need it immediately.  (Stupid thinking).  I was also studying 14 hours a day for interviews (for realz).   I saw devoting an hour plus to dick around on the phone as counter productive to getting employed in a competitive field.  Eventually I just reapplied and bit the bullet and called  As per before if you miss one of your very short windows you're booted out of the system.  You can try to file late, but they apparently don't want to hear that their system sucks shit, so I was denied.  I'm sure my reasoning that I was living off of savings/severance did not help my case. I'm employed now and thankful for it.  Most of my gut tells me to just move on as many more are in shittier situations now w/ the virus.  So, as part of my rage management I figured I'd just post it here and hope that someone else that is unemployed but not with a lot of time to waste can benefit.  Also note that it appears the current situation is butt-fucking their server and surprise, surprise, it can't handle it.  Keep this in mind moving forward."

However - I can imagine circumstances for other people where, if the had not been dire, if staff would have been freed up, it could be different.

She was admitted after the ER. As I understand it, normally my family would have been allowed in to see her. My aunt was granted one minute. My father and her husband, none. Can’t express how awful that feels.

The funeral will be live streamed; I can’t go because my grandpa is 90. Is my dad going to have to hold a phone or computer up? I mean... god.

My aunt is holding a mourning reception at her house. I can’t go because she’s 65.

Social distancing is going to make this take longer. 

I’m not trying to minimize the care she received. I’m sure it was top notch. But at this point, matter how valiant doctors and nurses can be, this is getting more and more extreme. Flattening the curve can help.

Hospitals getting overloaded WILL result in more people dying of things completely unrelated to the virus. People with standard emergencies will be triaged lower and even if they don’t contract the virus, they will die.

I don’t want condolences. I want people to give a damn and speak up to people who don’t, because

You do not want to use zoom to particulate in your grandmother’s funeral, wondering if people had taken this more seriously that things could have been different."

There are also four officers hanging out in front ignoring her.  Loathsome behavior I guess, but not against the law.

Then the passenger of her car just throws a full cup of soda out the window. Then a big paper bag full of garbage, and just kept throwing garbage out the window on the sidewalk. The officers looked up, but ignored them. We walked by the car, I stopped to glare at the two in the car from a few feet away, and they just ignored me, just as the officers ignored them.

But the fact of the matter is I'm just a dude who has a couple of clients at any given time. I’m basically a producer. I don’t do much of the retouching myself. I use freelancers.  

Last year I did well, but I mainly worked from May to November. That’s just when the work came in.  It was lucrative but not consistent. 

This year so far has been a wash. My main client from last year is a division of a major national retailer. The bulk of their work was photographed in the beginning of the year last year, and given to me starting in May. 

But I have no idea if they'll be back with as much volume this year, or any work at all. I did one or two images for them in January.

I don’t feel like I can call them in the middle of a pandemic looking for work. I know they’re all working from home.  It’s conceivable that they’re still shooting projects, working with their photographer remotely, but I don’t really know. 

I reluctantly looked at the Illinois form to apply for unemployment.  The first thing it asks is the name, address, and phone number of your previous employer.  The last thing I want is Illinois contacting my major client from last year and saying “The retouching company you used last year is seeking unemployment.”, especially if they had planned to start giving me work again in May. 

And are they even considered an employer? I know the newly announced relief package has some consideration for freelancers but I have no idea how it will work.

I also don't know how it works in Illinois, but I was on unemployment once in NYC and you had to go to all these job sessions and track your attempts to find work and submit proof. How am I supposed to do all that now, on lockdown?  I don’t drive so a delivery gig is out.

My wife works at a children's hospital so it’s not like our household has no income, but the future is uncertain. I have no idea if she will be called to work on the front lines. God forbid something happens to her, or she brings the virus home because I’m over 50, overweight and have elevated blood pressure.

tl;dr How does a small business sole proprietor get unemployment?"

Their Illinois license had expired earlier in 2020 and they never made it into renew it. The DMV has been closed (as much of the world). Apparently in order to file for unemployment, they must have a valid State ID or Driver's License. Therefore, are there any other avenues that my friend can seek, in order to file for unemployment during these strange times?

a couple nights ago I took my dog out at 2:30am and when I came back my key didn't work! it was registering flashing orange and denying me entry. I waited outside in 30° in the middle of the city. 5am someone finally comes down and let's me in and when I go up to my unit the key won't let me in! luckily I had my boyfriend in there if I didn't I would have been totally locked out with my dog!
it's been a few days of calling any number connected to the building I can find with no answers. we have to prop our door and the outside door open whenever we have to leave. it's insane. why can't we have normal keys?


I found a similar case but it was mainly on privacy which hadn't occurred to me before. are they tracking when I come and go? maybe.

&gt;Dear CTA Rider,

&gt;As people stay home and practice social distancing in response to COVID-19, we want you to know that CTA is continuing to run bus and rail service for those who need to get to critical jobs or need to travel for essential purposes.

&gt;During this time of uncertainty, CTA will be offering a one-time credit for any remaining days left on an active 7- or 30-day pass, based on when the pass was last used (more details below).

&gt;Additionally, we wanted to provide you with some helpful information regarding your Ventra account – specifically how to make the best use of any existing, inactive passes and other steps you can take to reduce your cost burden. 

&gt;***Prorated credit for active 7- and 30-day passes**: Customers with an active 7- or 30-day pass are eligible to receive a prorated credit for any remaining days, based on when the pass was last used.  For example, a 7-day pass that was activated on March 15 and used only that day, would be eligible for a prorated refund reflecting six unused days. Prorated credits will be issued as Transit Value that is added to the cardholder’s Ventra account. Transit Value can be used to purchase passes in the future or for rides paid for individually from your value balance.

&gt;To receive a Transit Value credit, send an email to Ventra Customer Service (customerservice@ventrachicago.com) with the following information no later than April 13, 2020:
&gt;1. Account holder’s name,
&gt;2. Transit account ID number, and
&gt;3. Type of pass (7- or 30-day) in which a credit is being requested.

&gt;Unlimited ride passes (1-, 3-, 7-, 30-day passes):  Passes are only activated when tapped at a rail station or on a bus, so if you do not need to ride CTA using one of these passes, simply save your Ventra Card with inactive passes until things return to normal. You can log in to your account online to see if you have any active or inactive passes. 
 
&gt;**Deactivating autoload feature**: If you have autoload enabled, you can easily deactivate this feature through the Ventra app or on our website (VentraChicago.com). And it’s just as easy to re-activate autoload when things get back to normal. 
 
&gt;**Pre-tax transit benefits**: If you use your employer’s pre-tax transit benefits program, you can contact your employer’s administrator to turn off a 30-Day Pass or Transit Value deposits. These deposits generally occur on 26th of each month. Please note that employers or third-party administrators may take some time to process your request."

Welcome to r/Chicago's weekly casual conversation and questions thread.

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations. 

We're currently working on updating our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/), but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the [Chicago Events Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=chicagosummercalendar@gmail.com)!

I hope you and yours are safe and well on the cusp of this new moon. My family and I are healthy and whole as of drafting this post. I know we're all worried out there, regardless of where we're from. I wish you and those you wish, strong health and patience. These are interesting times.

I find myself in an odd predicament that has led me to write this at such an eleventh hour. Truth is, I don't have anyone outside of the immediate family members under my roof. I have been at a complete loss as to who to talk to about this.

While I hate to be defined by only categories, I must take them into account when finding a place to live. I would be remiss if I didn't also acknowledge as well that the things that define me are amongst some of the reasons as to why I have settled my direction on moving to Chicago. 

Is there anywhere in Chicago you might suggest a couple of disabled, LGBT adults and their two, young, autistic kids look into living?

We have suddenly found ourselves in need of housing. We must be out of our current residence by March 30th. We are poor, have bad credit, stellar landlord reference, no evictions. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this,

But lately as i have been more frequent to social media (twitter and youtube, etc) while i read or watch any news/entertainment relating to Chicago in any kind, I've found a huge amount of ""dislike"" in the comment section of various post. 

At first it may not be visible, but after a while I've realized that most of the popular / top comment have these subtle (or not so subtle) hint of ""dislike"" and maybe even a lowly (insulting) jokes especially towards the minority. I just decided to foolishly assume that Chicago is full of closet racist.

So i decided to go to this sub and ask. As someone whose never been to the US let alone to the city, has Chicago change? Or has it been like that all these time?

Chicago has (to me) very surprisingly cheap real estate in the Wicker Park, Logan, even downtown etc. areas compared to NYC/SF, etc., such that owning a 2-3 bedroom and be downtown or in a Brooklyn-equivalent area in Chicago suddenly seems within reach given my current career (tech). 2-3 bedrooms for 4-700k just... don't exist in other cities with the cultural, architectural, public transit, and tech/finance vibrance that Chicago seems to share.

What I missing? The taxes, specifically property, or any other gotchas to moving/living in CHI? Specifically given I'm from a coastal expensive city already, so I'm aware of the general COLA increases. I'd love an explanation in layman's terms. I'm aware the IL Pension is dramatically underfunded, and from various comments I've pieced together in here, home owning appears to be a downside in that environment? Just how bad is it?

Also, I work in tech - tech industry and general companies that support those jobs in Chicago, growing or not?

But, we all have to make due in this situation and I've found video chats with my friends and co-workers to be super helpful! 

So with that in mind - let's hang out with each other. I'm thinking we can get a chat going sometime next week - get a group together, maybe all play the same Jackbox game or something of the like.

I have been homeless in Chicago for about 5 months. I usually I sleep at one of the airports and rarely get bothered because I don't look like I am homeless. I also buy a 7 day metro pass every week so I can catch a nap on the blue line if I need to. None of my family or friends know any of this. I rarely talk to other homeless people but am curious where they all went during this corona quarantine. I have seen like 10% the average amount of homeless people in the last few days. This is odd because I've seen nightly sweeps at the airport by police which used to occur once every few weeks. They are kicking homeless people out but I don't see anyone on the street.

The impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) has changed a lot over the past week. The situation has morphed into something that is impacting all of our lives on a daily basis. Our daily COVID-19 megathreads served us well in the beginning but, due to the ever-changing nature of COVID-19, we realize that regulating all coronavirus posts and discussions to a daily megathread will no longer be the best solution in handling the topic.

As of today, COVID-19 posts will be allowed on the main page of /r/Chicago. Please be mindful that our other rules are still in effect and posts that violate those rules will continue to be removed. General conversation posts (such as personal anecdotes, unverified reports of new cases, etc.) will be redirected to our [Weekly Questions/Conversation Megathread.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/fjgwme/rchicagos_weekly_casual_conversation_questions/)

We appreciate everyone’s feedback, and hope that you all stay safe during this challenging time. Please see below for links to COVID-19 resources that you may find helpful.

[\- **Follow the speed limit, 20 is plenty on side-streets.** Help lower trauma admissions at hospitals by reducing your speed.](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/05/31/3-graphs-that-explain-why-20-mph-should-be-the-limit-on-city-streets/) I know there are fewer cars out and more open road, but avoid the temptation.

\- **Complete stops at stop signs**. With CPS closed, there are a lot more kids out and about. Not only are they less likely to look when crossing, but they are lower to the ground and harder to see. Be aware that there could be more children biking through crosswalks than there usually would be during the weekday. Anecdotally, there seem to be more pedestrians in my area during the daytime than usual.

\- **Stop running yellows/reds.** I won't even explain this one.

While these are always good rules to follow, I can't think of a better time for Chicago drivers to start adjusting their driving habits. This is an unusual time and transportation modes are shifting. Be vigilant and kind to each other out there."

I'm located in Lincoln Square(ish) and completely out of work for the next few weeks.  Here's what I can offer:

\-If you're older or immunocompromised, or know someone who is, I'm happy to do a grocery store/pharmacy run. 

\-If you're a health care worker whose kids are suddenly at home due to the schools being out, I might be able to offer childcare or a home cooked meal."

I am the director of a corporate system’s investment fund. As of last week, my organization repurposed me to support our health system’s COVID-19 response and prep. 

Here’s one thing in working thru right now:

A high-priority initiative right now is getting credible information out to our community in order for people to respect social distancing and stay home. We need this in order to slow the spread of the virus and allow our health system resources to not become crippled by a massive influx of patients. We’re having the hardest time getting through to 18-29 year olds because that group sees themselves as low risk. Our organization is thinking about how to partner with local influencers to leverage their social media as a way to hopefully get the message across. We’ve contacted some influencer marketing companies but...honestly, this is something completely out of our expertise and we just want to reach many people as quickly as possible. 

Who are local influencers we should target?
How can we get in touch with them?

Are there any other crazy ideas you have that we should be thinking about?"

Should parents be expected to absorb the full financial cost of having to pay daycare and make arrangements for alternative care?  It appears the daycare would not be inconvenienced financially (and possibly benefit by having reduced overhead), if parents were forced to pay.  Any thoughts?"

1. Find a 24 hour parking garage with in and out privileges in a safe part of town.


2. Establish a cash-for-kitchen/shower deal with a friend or fellow student that lives near garage or on campus.

It’s a small thing but if there are any seniors out here in the north side of Chicago that need a grocery or pharmacy run and are too afraid to be in public, I would be willing to do one run on Saturday and one on Sunday.

I live in zip code 60625, I can pick up your list and money and deliver your groceries/supplies to you. PM me if you’d like support, or if you know anyone who could use the help.

Anyway, I’d like to not spread Corona around by avoiding congregating in a large mass going from bar to bar. However, many of my friends are from far away out of town (like other non-touching states). So the group is a mixed bag of staying in to celebrate and wanting to risk it because they already paid and traveled.


Anyway, this is more a vibe check with the Chicago community. Who is still going or not and why? Think there’s a chance for seeing some kind of refund? Have any grand advice for people who just moved to Chicago this year?"

A lot of service industry people are vulnerable because of our exposure to so many peoples’ germs and many of us are not as protected financially by high pay. Consider grocery delivery if you feel sick and be sure to not touch your delivery person. They’re doing the lord’s work.

22457,1584021730,Only 376 people tested in the State thus far. Call the Governor and demand drive-thru testing.,1584036130.0," According to the Illinois Department of Health's own website, we have only tested 376 individuals thus far in the state. As infected individuals are contagious for a week or more before showing symptoms, testing is the only way to get control of the situation. This virus is spread through the air, and washing your hands is not enough to stop the spread. I encourage everyone to educate themselves on this pandemic as it will likely be with us for the next 3 to 6 months.

The federal government is clearly failing at containing this outbreak and their refusal to expand testing is endangering lives. Washington state has implemented drive-thru testing on their own and we should be doing the same. Simply waiting until there are enough people who are infected before doing so is stupidity. Anyone who believes they have symptoms should have access to testing to prevent further spread of the disease.

I have called the Governor's office this morning and expressed my disappointment and concern that this is not already happening. I encourage all others to do the same, (please be respectful to the receptionist) PH# 217-782-6830. We need to ensure they cannot avoid our calls for increased testing."

I really, really need to find a better (And better paying) job. LinkedIn and Indeed are fine and all, but I'm not sure what keywords to give them that won't result in account manager or sales rep. I'm definitely against doing that.

In other words, I think of Foster to Berwyn (5200 to 5300 N) as *one block*, even if Farragut runs at 5230 N between them in a given area.

I think this way of thinking helps me make logical sense of the system... but then I saw a comment earlier that Wellington is ""four blocks"" from Belmont. My first thought was ""Nuh-uh!"" but my second was to ask myself ""Why is my way right?"" Existential crisis ensued.

So... I'm clearly an overthinker but, TL;DR: Is ""a block"" just the distance to the next street, no matter if it's a short block or long one? Totally not trying to argue, just want to understand what people mean when they use the term."

We are seeing major outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 develop in multiple European countries now because the authorities let various Carnival festivities occur late last month. The virus spread in China due to the mass movement of people during the Lunar holiday. It should be obvious to any so-called ""leader"" that the holiday mass gatherings of people should be stopped or canceled.

This virus has now caused multiple hospital systems around the world to collapse due to the intensity of infections. It has caused multiple countries to impose lockdowns over large geographic areas and strict quarantine regimens. It would be foolish to have a mass gathering in a city where it is extremely likely that the virus is spreading undetected among the population.

Coupled with the absolute lack of surveillance by public health authorities at local, state, and federal levels -- it is the worst malpractice by political leaders to pretend that the situation is anything close to normal. And it would be criminal to let something like the St. Pat's day parade happen in light of the pandemic engulfing the world.

22758,1583631088,I need to know about Bernie Sanders and his heart's ejection fraction,1583645488.0,"  

The American Heart Association states that ""...about 1 in 5 people who have a heart attack [will be readmitted](https://www.heart.org/en/news/2019/04/04/proactive-steps-can-reduce-chances-of-second-heart-attack) for another one within five years of their first. [https://www.heart.org/en/news/2019/04/04/proactive-steps-can-reduce-chances-of-second-heart-attack](https://www.heart.org/en/news/2019/04/04/proactive-steps-can-reduce-chances-of-second-heart-attack)

Bernie Sanders released numerous letters from his Doctor and Cardiologist where they stated that he has fully recovered and has the same working heart as most men his age.

However, I am troubled that he won't release his medical records to provide the details of the heart attack and the tests completed since he had it.

Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said he didn't think Sanders' refusal to release his medical records was transparent, and he added: *""Transparency matters. Especially living through the Trump era.* [https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/28/politics/bernie-sanders-heart-attack-health/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/28/politics/bernie-sanders-heart-attack-health/index.html)

Sanders could do what Senator John McCain did in 2008 during his campaign against then Senator Obama. McCain released 8 years of medical records to prove that he was fit and healthy enough to live during a four year term as President. [http://archive.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/05/24/medical\_records\_state\_mccain\_fit\_cancer\_free/](http://archive.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/05/24/medical_records_state_mccain_fit_cancer_free/)

Of particular interest to me is the issue of his heart's **ejection fraction**. 

For example, in a Letter to the Editor in the Washington Post, a retired anesthesiologist named John DesMarteau from Washington stated: ""*As a physician and a voter, I want to know which arteries were blocked. I also want to know what the function of his left ventricle is. His one-year risk of dying from a heart attack is proportional to his left ventricular ejection fraction — the percentage of blood that is pumped out of his left ventricle with each beat of his heart*.""

We've set this thread up so that folks have a place to post general topics that don't necessarily need their own post and for folks to ask questions and get recommendations.

We're currently working on updating our wiki, but quite a few of our FAQs are already addressed there.

Be sure to also check out the Chicago Events Calendar!

Any advice in going through this process would be great too. 

My fiancé and I are getting married in November and I have always want my uncle, who’s a priest in Ireland, to be the one who marries my future husband and me. Initially I thought it would be possible for him to marry us at at our wedding venue, although I didn’t not realize he is not able to do that. The parish I belong to is not an option due to its location and  i am not aware of any friends that have encountered this situation who would be able to give any advice.

Thank you in advance!"

Chicago police will not pursue charges against the apparently unarmed man who was [**shot by an officer at the Grand Red Line station**](https://cwbchicago.com/2020/03/after-years-of-steady-declines-officer-involved-shootings-rise-again-in-chicago.html) on Friday afternoon, according to CPD’s chief spokesperson.

“Chicago Police Supt. Charlie Beck has asked Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx to drop the resisting arrest and criminal narcotics charges that have been lodged against \[Ariel Roman\] by the CPD,” Anthony Guglielmi said in a press statement. “Given the totality of circumstances and the department’s significant level of concern around this incident, it would be insensitive to advocate for these charges.”"

The issue I want to present today is with Google Maps which fails to show the proper route for people walking to the station.  [https://imgur.com/a/pp1zXnP](https://imgur.com/a/pp1zXnP) (Zoom in to 200x if you need to)
