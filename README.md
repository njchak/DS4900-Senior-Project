### Motivation for Our Project ###
For our project, we wanted to see how overall sentiment changed over time during Covid-19, to see if there was a pattern that could be drawn, as well as observing changes in the overall number of covid cases, focusing on a few core cities. Comparing the city data has given us some interesting results, as well as seeing how the sentiment and daily case numbers compare over time.
